In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.\n\nYou see\u2014in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming\u2014the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends. The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.\n\nIt became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.\n\nBeing a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn\u2019t sensationalize or sexualize that\u2014right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.\n\nBut none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.\n\nThere was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of na\u00efvet\u00e9, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of na\u00efvet\u00e9, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.\n\nI'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in \"Blank Space\" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in \"Welcome To New York.\" You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.\n\nI was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly.

We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\n\nThis is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\n\nThe point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.\nWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?\n\nLet me say it again, louder for those

These wounds I receiv'd in\nDefence of your liberty; this eye was lost in your service; lend me a\nHand to hand me to my children, for my faltering hams are not able to\nSupport me\n\n\"Yet even this might pass for tolerable, did it put young beginners in\nThe least way to well-speaking. Whereas now, what with the inordinate\nSwelling of matter, and the empty ratling of words, they only gain\nThis, That when they come to appear in publick, they think themselves\nIn another world. And therefore I look upon the young fry of\nCollegiates as likely to make the most helpful blockheads, because\nThey neither hear nor see any thing that is in use among men: But a\nCompany of pirates with their chains on the shoar; tyrants issuing\nProclamations to make children kill their fathers; the answers of\nOracles in a plague-time, that three or more virgins be sacrific'd to\nAppease the gods; dainty fine honey-pellets of words, and everything\nSo said and done, as if it were all spice and garnish\n\"Those that are thus bred can no more understand, than those that live\nIn a kitchin not stink of the grease. Give me, with your favour\nLeave to say, 'twas you first lost the good grace of speaking; for\nWith light idle gingles of words to make sport ye have brought it to\nThis, That the substance of oratory is become effeminate and sunk\n\n\"Young men were not kept to this way of declaiming when Sophocles and\nEuripides influenc'd the age. Nor yet had any blind alley-professor\nFoil'd their inclinations, when Pindar and the Nine Lyricks durst not\nAttempt Homer's Numbers: And that I may not bring my authority from\nPoets, 'tis certain, neither Plato nor Demosthenes ever made it their\nPractice: A stile one would value, and as I may call it, a chast\nOration, is not splatchy nor swoll'n, but rises with a natural beauty\n\n\"This windy and irregular way of babbling came lately out of Asia into\nAthens; and having, like some ill planet, blasted the aspiring genius\nOf their youth, at once corrupted and put a period to all true\nEloquence\n\n\"After this, who came up to the height of Thucydides? Who reach'd the\nFame of Hyperedes? Nay, there was hardly a verse of a right strain:\nBut all, as of the same batch, di'd with their author. Painting also\nMade no better an end, after the boldness of the Egyptians ventur'd to\nBring so great an art into a narrower compass.\"\n\nAt this and the like rate my self once declaim'd, when one Agamemnon\nMade up to us, and looking sharply on him, whom the mob with such\nDiligence observ'd, he would not suffer me to declaim longer in the\nPortico, than he had sweated in the school; \"But, young man,\" said he\n\"because your discourse is beyond the common apprehension, and, which\nIs not often seen, that you are a lover of understanding, I won't\nDeceive you: The masters of these schools are not to blame, who think\nIt necessary to be mad with mad men: For unless they teach what their\nScholars approve, they might, as Cicero says, keep school to\nThemselves: like flattering smell-feasts, who when they come to great\nMen's tables study nothing more than what they think may be most\nAgreeable to the company (as well knowing they shall never obtain what\nThey would, unless they first spread a net for their bars) so a master\nOf eloquence, unless fisherman like, he bait his hook with what he\nKnows the fish will bite at, may wait long enough on the rock without\nHopes of catching any thing\n\"Where lies the fault then? Parents ought to be sharply reprehended\nWho will not have their children come on by any strict method; but in\nThis, as in all things, are so fond of making a noise in the world;\nAnd in such haste to compass their wishes, that they hurry them in\nPublick e'er they have digested what they have read, and put children\nE'er they are well past their sucking-bottle, upon the good grace of\nSpeaking, than which even themselves confess, nothing is greater:\nWhereas if they would suffer them to come up by degrees, that their\nStudies might be temper'd with grave lectures; their affections\nFashion'd by the dictates of wisdom; that they might work themselves\nInto a mastery of words; and for a long time hear, what they're\nInclined to imitate, nothing that pleas'd children, wou'd be admir'd\nBy them. But now boys trifle in the schools, young men are laugh'd at\nIn publick, and, which is worse than both, what every one foolishly\nTakes up in his youth, no one will confess in his age. But that I may\nNot be thought to condemn Lucilius, as written in haste, I also will\nGive you my thoughts in verse\n\n\"Who ere wou'd with ambitious just desire\nTo mastery in so fire an art aspire\nMust all extreams first diligently shun\nAnd in a settled course of vertue run\nLet him not fortune with stiff greatness climb\nNor, courtier-like, with cringes undermine:\nNor all the brother blockheads of the pot\nEver persuade him to become a sot;\nNor flatter poets to acquire the fame\nOf, I protest, a pretty gentleman\nBut whether in the war he wou'd be great\nOr, in the gentler arts that rule a state;\nOr, else his amorous breast he wou'd improve\nWell to receive the youthful cares of love\nIn his first years to poetry inclin'd\nLet Homer's spring bedew his fruitful mind;\nHis manlier years to manlier studies brought\nPhilosophy must next imply his thought\nThen let his boundless soul new glories fire\nAnd to the great Demosthenes aspire\nWhen round in throngs the list'ning people come\nT'admire what sprung in Greece so slow at home\nRais'd to this height, your leisure hours engage\nIn something just and worthy of the stage;\nYour choice of words from Cicero derive\nAnd in your poems you design shou'd live\nThe joys of feasts, and terrors of a war\nMore pleasing those, and these more frightful are\nWhen told by you, than in their acting were:\nAnd thus, enrich'd with such a golden store\nYou're truly fit to be an orator.\"\nWhile I was wholly taken up with Agamemnon, I did not observe how\nAscyltos had given me the slip, and as I continu'd my diligence, a\nGreat crowd of scholars fill'd the portico, to hear, (as it appear'd\nAfterwards) an extemporary declamation, of I know not whom, that was\nDiscanting on what Agamemnon had said; while therefore they ridicul'd\nHis advice, and condemn'd the order of the whole, I took an\nOpportunity of getting from them, and ran in quest of Ascyltos: But\nThe hurry I was in, with my ignorance where our inn lay, so distracted\nMe, that what way soever I went, I return'd by the same, till tir'd in\nThe pursuit, and all in a sweat, I met an old herb-woman: And, \"I\nBeseech ye, mother,\" quoth I, \"do you know whereabouts I dwell?\"\nPleas'd with the simplicity of such a home-bred jest, \"Why should I\nNot?\" answer'd she; and getting on her feet went on before me: I\nThought her no less than a witch: but, having led me into a bye lane\nShe threw off her pyebal'd patch't-mantle, and \"here,\" quoth she, \"you\nCan't want a lodging.\"\n\nWhile I was denying I knew the house, I observ'd a company of beaux\nReading the bills o'er the cells, on which was inscrib'd the name of\nThe whore and her price; and others of the same function naked\nScuttling it here and there, as if they would not, yet would be seen:\nWhen too late I found my self in a bawdy-house, cursing the jade that\nHad trapan'd me thither, I cover'd my head and was just making off\nThrough the midst of them, when in the very entry Ascyltos met me, but\nAs tir'd as my self, and in a manner dead; you'd have sworn the same\nOld woman brought him. I could not forbear laughing, but having\nSaluted each other, I ask'd what business he had in so scandalous a\nPlace? He wip'd his face, and \"if you knew,\" said he, \"what has\nHappened to me--\" \"As what?\" quoth I\n\nHe faintly reply'd \"When I had rov'd the whole city without finding\nWhere I had left the inn, the master of this house came up to me, and\nKindly profer'd to be my guide; so through many a cross lane and blind\nTurning, having brought me to this house, he drew his weapon and prest\nFor a closer ingagement. In this affliction the whore of the cell\nAlso demanded garnish-money; and he laid such hands on me, that had I\nNot been too strong for him, I had gone by the worst of it.\"\n\nWhile Ascyltos was telling his tale, in come the same fellow, with a\nWoman, none of the least agreeable, and looking upon Ascyltos\nEntreated him to walk in and fear nothing, for if he would not be\nPassive he might be active: the woman on the other hand press'd me to\nGo in with her. We follow'd therefore, and being led among those\nBills, we saw many of both sexes at work in the cells, so much every\nOf them seem'd to have taken a provocative\n\nNor were we sooner discover'd than they wou'd have been at us with the\nLike impudence, and in a trice one of them, his coat tuck'd under his\nGirdle, laid hold on Ascyltos, and threw him athwart a couch: I\nPresently ran to help the undermost, and putting our strengths\nTogether, we made nothing of the troublesome fool. Ascyltos went off\nAnd flying, left me expos'd to the fury; but, thanks to my strength, I\nGot off without hurt\n\nI had almost traverst the city round, when through the dusk I saw Gito\nOn the beggars-bench of our inn; I made up to him, and going in, ask'd\nHim, what Ascyltos had got us for dinner? the boy sitting down on the\nBed, began to wipe the tears that stood in his eyes; I was much\nConcern'd at it, and ask'd him the occasion; he was slow in his\nAnswer, and seem'd unwilling; but mixing threats with my intreaties;\n\"'Twas that brother or comrogue of yours,\" said he, \"that coming ere\nWhile into our lodging, wou'd have been at me, and put hard for it\nWhen I cry'd out, he drew his sword, and 'if thou art a Lucreece,'\nSaid he, 'thou hast met a Tarquin.'\"\n\nI heard him, and shaking my fist at Ascyltos; \"What saist thou,\" said\nI, \"thou catamite, whose very breath is tainted?\"\n\nHe dissembled at first a great trembling, but presently throwing my\nArms aside, in a higher voice cry'd out: \"Must you be prating, thou\nRibaldrous cut-throat whom, condemn'd for murdring thine host, nothing\nBut the fall of the stage could have sav'd? You make a noise, thou\nNight-pad, who when at thy best hadst never to do with any woman but a\nBawd? On what account, think ye, was I the same to you in the aviary\nThat the boy here, now is!\"\n\n\"And who but you,\" interrupted I, \"gave me that slip in the portico?\"\n\"Why what, my Man of Gotham,\" continu'd he, \"must I have done, when I\nWas dying for hunger? Hear sentence forsooth, that is, the ratling of\nBroken glasses, and the expounding of dreams? So help me Hercules, as\nThou art the greater rogue of the two, who to get a meals meat wert\nNot asham'd to commend an insipid rhimer.\" When at last, having\nTurn'd the humour from scolding to laughing, we began to talk soberly\n\nBut the late injury still sticking in my stomach, \"Ascyltos,\" said I\n\"I find we shall never agree together, therefore let's divide the\nCommon stock, and each of us set up for himself: Thou'rt a piece of a\nScholar, and I'll be no hindrance to thee, but think of some other\nWay; for otherwise we shall run into a thousand mischiefs, and become\nTown-talk.\"\n\nAscyltos was not against it; and \"Since we have promis'd,\" said he\n\"as scholars, to sup together, let's husband the night too: and\nTo-morrow I'll get me a new lodging, and some comrade or other.\"\n\n\"'Tis irksome,\" said I, \"to defer what we like\" (the itch of the flesh\nOccasion'd this hasty parting, tho' I had been a long time willing to\nShake off so troublesome an observer of my actions, that I might renew\nMy old intrigue with my Gito)\n\nAscyltos taking it as an affront, without answering, went off in a\nHeat: I was too well acquainted with his subtle nature, and the\nViolence of his love, not to fear the effects of so suddain a breach\nAnd therefore made after him, both to observe his designs and prevent\nThem; but losing sight of him, was a long time in pursuit to no\nPurpose\n\nWhen I had search'd the whole town, I return'd to my lodging, where\nThe ceremony of kisses ended, I got my boy to a closer hug, and\nEnjoying my wishes, thought myself happy even to envy: Nor had I done\nWhen Ascyltos stole to the door, and springing the bolt, found us at\nLeap-frog; upon which, clapping his hands, he fell a laughing, and\nTurning me out of the saddle; \"What,\" said he, \"most reverend\nGentleman, what were you doing, my brother sterling?\" Not content\nWith words only, but untying the thong that bound his wallet, he gave\nMe a warning, and with other reproaches, \"As you like this, so be for\nParting again.\"\n\nThe unexpectedness of the thing made me take no notice of it, but\nPolitickly turn it off with a laugh; for otherwise I must have been at\nLoggar-heads with my rival: Whereas sweetening him with a counterfeit\nMirth, I brought him also to laugh for company: \"And you, Encolpius,\"\nBegan he, \"are so wrapt in pleasures, you little consider how short\nOur money grows, and what we have left will turn to no account:\nThere's nothing to be got in town this summertime, we shall have\nBetter luck in the country; let's visit our friends.\"\n\nNecessity made me approve his advice, as well as conceal the smart of\nHis lash; so loading Gito with our baggage, we left the city, and went\nTo the house of one Lycurgus, a Roman knight; who, because Ascyltos\nHad formerly been his pathick, entertain'd us handsomly; and the\nCompany, we met there, made our diversions the pleasanter: For, first\nThere was Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, a very beautiful woman, that had come with one\nLycas, the owner of a ship, and of a small seat, that lay next the\nSea\n\nThe delight we receiv'd in this place was more than can be exprest\nTho' Lycurgus's table was thrifty enough: The first thing was every\nOne to chuse his play-mate: The fair Tryph\u00c5\u201cna pleas'd me, and\nReadily inclin'd to me; but I had scarce given her the courtesie of\nThe house, when Lycas storming to have his old amour slockt from him\nAccus'd me at first of under-dealing; but soon from a rival addressing\nHimself as a lover, he pleasantly told me, I must repair his damages\nAnd plyed me hotly: But Tryph\u00c5\u201cna having my heart, I could not lend\nHim an ear. The refusal set him the sharper; he follow'd me\nWhere-ever I went, and getting into my chamber at night, when entreaty\nDid no good, he fell to downright violence; but I rais'd such an\nOutcry that I wak'd the whole house, and, by the help of Lycurgus, got\nRid of him for that bout\n\nAt length perceiving Lycurgus's house was not for his purpose, he\nWould have persuaded me to his own; but I rejecting the proffer, he\nMade use of Tryph\u00c5\u201cna's authority; and she the rather persuaded me\nTo yield to him, because she was in hopes of living more at liberty\nThere. I follow'd therefore whither my love led me; but Lycurgus\nHaving renew'd his old concern with Ascyltos, wou'd not suffer him to\nDepart: At last we agreed, that he shou'd stay with Lycurgus, and we\nGo with Lycas: Over and beside which, it was concluded, that every of\nUs, as opportunity offer'd, should pilfer what he could for the common\nStock\n\nLycas was overjoy'd at my consent, and so hasten'd our departure\nThat, taking leave of our friends, we arriv'd at his house the same\nDay. But in our passage he so order'd the matter that he sate next\nMe, and Tryph\u00c5\u201cna next Gito, which he purposely contriv'd to show\nThe notorious lightness of that woman; nor was he mistaken in her, for\nShe presently grew hot upon the boy: I was quickly jealous, and Lycas\nSo exactly remark'd it to me, that he soon confirm'd my suspicion of\nHer. On this I began to be easier to him, which made him all joy, as\nBeing assur'd the unworthiness of my new mistress wou'd beget my\nContempt of her, and resenting her slight, I shou'd receive him with\nThe better will\n\nSo stood the matter while we were at Lycas's: Tryph\u00c5\u201cna was\nDesperately in love with Gito; Gito again as wholly devoted to her; I\nCar'd least for the sight of either of them; and Lycas studying to\nPlease me, found me every day some new diversion: In all which also\nHis wife Doris, a fine woman, strove to exceed him, and that so gayly\nThat she presently thrust Tryph\u00c5\u201cna from my heart: I gave her the\nWink, and she return'd her consent by as wanton a twinckle; so that\nThis dumb rhetorick going before the tongue, secretly convey'd each\nOthers mind\n\nI knew Lycas was jealous, which kept me tongue-ty'd so long, and the\nLove he bore his wife made him discover to her, his inclination to me:\nBut the first opportunity we had of talking together, she related to\nMe what she had learn'd from him; and I frankly confess'd it, but\nWithal told her how absolutely averse I had ever been to't: \"Well\nThen,\" quoth the discreet woman, \"we must try our wits, according to\nHis own opinion, the permission was one's, and the possession\nAnother's.\"\n\nBy this time Gito had been worn off his legs, and was gathering new\nStrength, when Tryph\u00c5\u201cna came back to me, but disappointed of her\nExpectations, her love turn'd to a downright fury; and, all on fire\nWith following me to no purpose, got into my intrigue both with Lycas\nAnd his wife: She made no account of his gamesomeness with me, as well\nKnowing it wou'd hinder no grist to her mill: But for Doris, she never\nLeft till she had found out our private amours, and gave a hint of it\nTo Lycas; whose jealousie having got the upper hand of his love, ran\nAll to revenge; but Doris, advertis'd by Tryph\u00c5\u201cna's woman, to\nDivert the storm, forbore any such meetings\n\nAs soon as I perceiv'd it, having curs'd the treachery of Tryph\u00c5\u201cna\nAnd the ingratitude of Lycas, I began to make off, and fortune\nFavour'd me: For a ship consecrated to the Goddess Isis, laden with\nRich spoils, had the day before run upon the rocks\n\nGito and I laid our heads together, and he was as willing as my self\nTo be gone; for Tryph\u00c5\u201cna having drawn him dry, began now not to be\nSo fond of him. Early the next morning therefore we march'd to\nSea-ward, where with the less difficulty we got on board the ship\nBecause we were no strangers to Lycas's servants then in wait upon\nHer: They still honouring us with their company, it was not a time to\nFilch any thing; but, leaving Gito with them, I took an opportunity of\nGetting into the stern, where the image of Isis stood, and strip'd her\nOf a rich mantle, and silver taber, lifting other good booty out of\nThe master's cabin, I stole down by a rope, unseen by any but Gito;\nWho also gave them the slip and sculk'd after me\n\nAs soon as I saw him I shew'd him the purchase, and both of us\nResolv'd to make what haste we could to Ascyltos, but Lycurgus's house\nWas not to be reach'd the same day: When we came to Ascyltos we shew'd\nHim the prize, and told him in short the manner of getting it, and how\nWe were made a meer may-game of love: He advis'd us to prepossess\nLycurgus with our case, and make him our friend ere the others could\nSee him; and withal boldly assert it, that the trick Lycas would have\nServed them, was the only cause why they stole away so hastily; which\nWhen Lycurgus came to understand, he swore he would at all times\nProtect us against our enemies\n\nOur fight was unknown till Tryph\u00c5\u201cna and Doris were got out of bed;\nFor we daily attended their levy, and waited on them while they were\nDressing; but, when contrary to custom they found us missing, Lycas\nTent after us, and especially to the sea-side, for he had heard we\nMade that way, but not a word of the pillage, for the ship lay\nSomewhat to sea-ward, and the master had not yet return'd on board\n\nBut at last it being taken for granted we had run away, and Lycas\nBecoming uneasie for want of us, fell desperately foul on his wife\nWhom he suppos'd to be the cause of our departure: I'll take no notice\nOf what words and blows past between them; I know not every\nParticular: I'll only say, Tryph\u00c5\u201cna, the mother of mischief, had\nPut Lycas in the head, that it might so be, we had taken sanctuary at\nLycurgus's, where she persuaded him to go in quest of the runnagates\nAnd promis'd to bear him company, that she might confound our\nImpudence with just reproaches\n\nThe next day they accordingly set forward, and came to his house; but\nWe were out of the way: For Lycurgus was gone to a festival in honour\nOf Hercules, held at a neighbouring village, and had taken us with\nHim, of which when the others were inform'd, they made what haste they\nCould to us, and met us in the portico of the temple. The sight of\nThem very much disordered us: Lycas eagerly complained of our flight\nTo Lycurgus, but was received with such a bended brow, and so haughty\nA look, that I grew valiant upon't, and with an open throat charg'd\nHim with his beastly attempts upon me, as well at Lycurgus's as in his\nOwn house; and Tryph\u00c5\u201cna endeavouring to stop my mouth, had her\nShare with him, for I set out her harlotry to the mob, who were got\nAbout us to hear the scolding: And as a proof of what I said, I shew'd\nThem poor sapless Gito, and my self also, whom that itch of the whore\nHad even brought to our graves\n\nThe shout of the mob put our enemies so out of countenance that they\nWent off heavily, but contriving a revenge; and therefore observing\nHow we had put upon Lycurgus, they went back to expect him at his\nHouse, and set him right again. The solemnity ending later than was\nExpected, we could not reach Lycurgus's that night, and therefore he\nBrought us to a half-way house, but left us asleep next morning, and\nWent home to despatch some business, where he found Lycas and\nTryph\u00c5\u201cna waiting for him, who so ordered the matter with him, that\nThey brought him to secure us. Lycurgus naturally barbarous and\nFaithless, began to contrive which way to betray us, and sent Lycas to\nGet some help, whilst he secured us in the village\n\nThither he came, ard at his first entry, treated us as Lycas had done:\nAfter which wringing his hands together, he upbraided us with the lye\nWe had made of Lycas, and taking Ascyltos from us, lock'd us up in the\nRoom where we were, without so much as hearing him speak in our\nDefence; but carrying him to his house, set a guard upon us, till\nHimself should return\n\nOn the road Ascyltos did what he could to mollifie Lycurgus; but\nNeither entreaties, nor love, nor tears doing any good on him, it came\nInto our comerades head to set us at liberty, and being all on fire at\nLycurgus's restiness, refus'd to bed with him that night, and by that\nMeans the more easily put in execution what he had been thinking on\n\nThe family was in their dead sleep when Ascyltos took our fardels on\nHis shoulders, and getting through a breach in the wall, which he had\nFormerly taken notice of, came to the village by break of day, and\nMeeting no one to stop him, boldly enter'd it and came up to our\nChamber; which the guard that was upon us, took care to secure; but\nThe bar being of wood, he easily wrenched it with an iron crow, and\nWaken'd us; for we snor'd in spight of fortune\n\nOur guard had so over-watched themselves, that they were fall'n into a\nDead sleep, and we only wak'd at the crack. To be short, Ascyltos\nCame in and briefly told us what he had done for our sakes: On this we\nGot up; and as we were rigging our selves, it came into my head to\nKill the guard, and rifle the village; I told Ascyltos my mind. He\nLiked the rifling well enough, but gave us a wish'd delivery without\nBlood, for being acquainted with every corner of the house, he pick'd\nThe lock of an inner-room where the movables lay, and bringing us into\nIt, we lifted what was of most value, and got off while it was yet\nEarly in the morning; avoiding the common road, and not resting till\nWe thought our selves out of danger\n\nThen Ascyltos having got heart again, began to amplifie the delight he\nTook in having pillag'd Lycurgus; of whose miserableness he, not\nWithout cause, complain'd; for he neither paid him for his nights\nService, nor kept a table that had either meat, or drink on't, being\nSuch a sordid pinch-peny; that, notwithstanding his infinite wealth\nHe deny'd himself the common necessaries of life\n\nUnhappy Tantalus, amidst the flood\nWhere floating apple on the surface roll'd\nEver pursu'd them with a longing eye\nYet could not thurst nor hunger satisfie\nSuch is the miser's fate; who midst his store\nFearing to use, is miserably poor\n\nAscyltos would have been for Naples the same day, had I not told him\nHow imprudent it was to take up there, where, forasmuch as could be\nConjectur'd, we were most likely to be sought after: \"And therefore,''\nSaid I, \"let's keep out of the way for the present, and, since we have\nEnough to keep us from want, stroul it about till the heat be over.\"\nThe advice was approv'd, and we set forward for a pleasant\nCountry-town, where we were sure to meet some of our acquaintance that\nWere taking the benefit of the season: But we were scarce got half\nWay, when a shower of rain emptying it self upon us like buckets\nForc'd us into the next village; where entring the inn, we saw a great\nMany others that had also struck in, to avoid the storm. The throng\nKept us from being taken notice of, and gave us the opportunity of\nPrying here and there, what we might filch in a crowd, when Ascyltos\nUnheeded of any one, took a purse from the ground, in which he found\nSeveral pieces of gold; we leap'd for joy at so fortunate a beginning;\nBut fearing, lest some or other might seek after it, we slunk out at a\nBack-door, where we saw a groom saddling his horses; but, as having\nForgotten somewhat, he run into the house leaving behind him an\nEmbroider'd mantle, mail'd to one of the saddles: In his absence I cut\nThe straps and under the covert of some out-sheds we made off with it\nTo a neighbouring forest. Being more out of danger among the thickets\nWe cast about where we should hide the gold that we might not be\nEither charg'd with the felony, or robb'd of it our selves: At last we\nConcluded to sow it in the lining of an old patcht coat which I threw\nOver my shoulders and entrusted the care of the mantle to Ascyltos, in\nDesign to get to the city by cross-ways: But as we were going out we\nHeard somewhat on our left hand to this purpose: \"They shall not\nEscape us; they came into the wood; let's separate ourselves and beat\nAbout, that we may the better discover and take them.\" This put us\nInto such a fright that Ascyltos and Gito fled through briars and\nBrambles to the city-ward; but I turn'd back again in such a hurry\nThat without perceiving it the precious coat drop'd from my shoulders:\nAt last being quite tir'd and not able to go any further, I laid me\nDown under the shelter of a tree where I first miss'd the coat: Then\nGrief restor'd my strength, and up I got again to try if I could\nRecover the treasure; I ran hither and thither and every where but to\nNo purpose; but spent and wasted between toil and heaviness, I got\nInto a thicket, where having tarried four hours, and half dead with\nThe horror of the place, I sought the way out; but going forward, a\nCountry-man came in sight of me: Then I had need of all my confidence\nNor did it fail me: I went up roundly to him, and making my moan how I\nHad lost my self in the wood, desir'd him tell me the was to the city:\nHe pittying my figure (for I was as pale as death, and all bemir'd)\nAsk'd me if I had seen any one in the wood? I answer'd, not a\nSoul--on which he courteously brought me into the highway, where he\nMet two of his friends, who told him, they had travers'd the wood\nThro' and thro' but had light upon nothing but a coat, which they\nShew'd him\n\nIt may easily be believed I had not the courage to challenge it, tho'\nI knew well enough what the value of it was: This struck me more than\nAll the rest; however, bewailing my treasure, the country-man not\nHeeding me, and feebleness growing upon me, I slacken'd my pace, and\nJogg'd on slower than ordinarily\n\nIt was longer e're I reach'd the city than I thought of; but coming to\nThe inn, I found Ascyltos half dead, and stretcht on a straw pallet\nAnd fell on another my self, not able to utter a word: He missing the\nCoat was in a great disorder, and hastily demanded of me, what was\nBecome of it: I on the other hand, scarce able to draw my breath\nResolv'd him by my languishing eyes, what my tongue would not give me\nLeave to speak: At length recovering by little and little, I plainly\nTold him the ill luck I had met with: But he thought I jested, and\nTho' the tears in my eyes might have been as full evidence to him as\nAn oath, he yet questioned the truth of what I said, and would not\nBelieve but I had a mind to cheat him. During this, Gito stood as\nTroubled as my self, and the boy's sadness increased mine: But the\nFresh suit that was after us, distracted me most. I opened the whole\nTo Ascyltos who seem'd little concern'd at it, as having luckily got\nOff for the present, and withal assur'd himself, that we were past\nDanger, in that we were neither known, nor seen by any one: However\nIt was thought fit to pretend a sickness, that we might have the\nBetter pretext to keep where we were: But our monies falling shorter\nThan we thought of, and necessity enforcing us, we found it high time\nTo sell some of our pillage\n\nIt was almost dark, when going into the brokers market, we saw\nAbundance of things to be bought and sold: of no extraordinary value\n'tis true; yet such whose night-walking trade, the dusk of the evening\nMight easily conceal. We also had the mantle with us, and taking the\nOpportunity of a blind corner, fell a shaking the skirt of it, to try\nIf so glittering a shew would bring us a purchaser; nor had we been\nLong there, e're a certain country-man, whom I thought I had seen\nBefore, came up to us with a hussye that follow'd him, and began to\nConsider the mantle more narrowly, as on rhe other side did Ascyltos\nOur country chapman's shoulders, which presently startled him, and\nStruck him dumb, nor could my self behold 'em without being concern'd\nAt it, for he seemed to me to be the same fellow that had found the\nCoat in the wood, as in truth he was: But Ascyltos doubting whether he\nMight trust his eyes or not, and that he might not do any thing\nRashly, first came nearer to him as a buyer, and taking the coat from\nHis shoulders, began to cheapen, and turn it more carefully. O the\nWonderful vagaries of fortune! for the country-man had not so much as\nExamined a seam of it, but carelessly exposed it as beggars-booty\n\nAscyltos seeing the coat unript, and the person of the seller\nContemptible, took me aside from the crowd: And \"Don't you see\nBrother,\" said he, \"the treasure I made such moan about is returned?\nThat's the coat with the gold in't, all safe and untoucht: What\nTherefore do we do, or what course shall we take to get our own\nAgain?\"\n\nI now comforted, not so much that I had seen the booty, but had\nClear'd my self of the suspicion that lay upon me, was by no means for\nGoing about the bush, but down-right bringing an action against him\nThat if the fellow would not give up the coat to the right owner, we\nMight recover it by law:\n\nLaws bear the name, but money has the power;\nThe cause is bad when e'er the client's poor:\nThose strickt liv'd men that seem above our world\nAre oft too modest to resist our gold\nSo judgment, like our other wares, is sold;\nAnd the grave knight that nods upon the laws\nWak'd by a fee, hems, and approves the cause\n\nAscyltos on the other side afraid of the law, \"Who,\" said he, \"knows\nUs in this place, or will give any credit to what we say? I am clear\nFor buying it, tho' we know it to be our own, and rather recover the\nTreasure with a little money, than embroil our selves in an uncertain\nSuit\"; but we had not above a couple of groats ready money, and that\nWe design'd should buy us somewhat to eat. Least therefore the coat\nShould be gone in the mean time, we agreed, rather than fail, to sell\nThe mantle at a lower price, that the advantage we got by the one\nMight make what we lost by the other more easie\n\nAs soon therefore as we had spread open the mantle, the woman that\nStood muffled by the country-man, having pryingly taken notice of some\nTokens about it, forceably laid both hands on't, and setting up her\nThroat, cryed out, \"Thieves, thieves!\"\n\nWe on the t'other part being disordered at it, lest yet he might seem\nTo do nothing, got hold of the totter'd coat, and as spitefully\nRoar'd, they had robb'd us of it: But our case was in no wise like\nTheirs, and the rabble that came in to the out-cry, ridicul'd, as they\nWere won't, the weaker side, in that the others laid claim to so rich a\nMantle, and we to a ragged coat, scarce worth a good patch. At this\nAscyltos could hardly keep his countenance; but the noise being over\nWe see, said he, how every one likes his own best, give us our coat\nAnd let them take the mantle\n\nThe country-man and the woman lik'd the exchange well enough, but a\nSort of petty-foggers, most of whose business was such night practice\nHaving a mind to get the mantle themselves, as importunately required\nThat both mantle and coat should be left in their hands, and the judge\nWould hear their complaints on the morrow: For it was not the things\nAlone that seem'd to be in dispute, but quite another matter to be\nEnquir'd into, to wit, a strong suspicion of robbery on both sides\n\nAt last it was agreed to put both into some indifferent hand, till the\nRight were determin'd; when presently one, I know not who, with a bald\nPate, and a face full of pimples, he had been formerly a kind of\nSolicitor, steps out of the rout, and laying hold on the mantle, said\nHe'd be security it should be forth-coming the next day: when in truth\nHe intended nothing more, but that having gotten it into hucksters\nHands, it might be smugled among them, as believing we would never\nCome to own it, for fear of being taken up for it; for our part we\nWere as willing as he; and an accident befriended both of us: For the\nCountry-man thinking scorn of it, that we demanded to have the patcht\nCoat given us, threw it at Ascyltos's head, and discharging us of\nEverything but the mantle, required that to be secur'd as the only\nCause of the dispute. Having therefore recovered, as we thought, our\nTreasure, we made all the haste we could to the inn, and having shut\nThe door upon us, made our selves merry, as well with the Judgment of\nThe rabble as of our detractors, who with so much circumspection had\nRestor'd us our money\n\nWhile we were ripping the coat and taking out the gold, we overheard\nSomebody asking mine host, what kind of people those were that had\nJust now come in, and being startled at it, I went down to see what\nWas the matter, and understood that a city serjeant, who according to\nThe duty of his office, took an account of all strangers, and had seen\nA couple come into the inn, whose names he had not yet registered, and\nTherefore, inquired of what country they were, and what way of living\nThey had\n\nBut mine host gave me such a blind account of it, that I began to\nSuspect we were not safe there; whereupon for fear of being taken up\nWe thought fit to go off for the present, and not come back again till\nIt was in the night, but leave the care of our supper to Gito\n\nWe had resolv'd to keep out of the broad streets, and accordingly took\nOur walk thro' that quarter of the city where we were likely to meet\nLeast company; when in a narrow winding lane that had not passage\nThro', we saw somewhat before us, two comely matron-like women, and\nFollowed them at a distance to a chappel, which they entred, whence we\nHeard an odd humming kind of noise, as if it came from the hollow of a\nCave: Curiosity also made us go in after them, where we saw a number\nOf women, as mad as they had been sacrificing to Bacchus, and each of\nThem an amulet (the ensign of Priapus) in her hand. More than that we\nCould not get to see; for they no sooner perceived us, than they set\nUp such a shout, that the roof of the temple shook agen, and withal\nEndeavoured to lay hands on us; but we scamper'd and made what haste\nWe could to the inn\n\nNor had we sooner stuff'd our selves with the supper Gito had got for\nUs, when a more than ordinary bounce at the door, put us into another\nFright; and when we, pale as death, ask'd who was there, 'twas\nAnswer'd, \"Open the door and you'll see:\" While we were yet talking\nThe bolt drop'd off, and the door flew open, on which, a woman with\nHer head muffl'd came in upon us, but the same who a little before had\nStood by the country-man in the market: \"And what,\" said she, \"do you\nThink to put a trick upon me? I am Quartilla's maid, whose sacred\nRecess you so lately disturb'd: she is at the inn-gate and desires to\nSpeak with ye: not that she either taxes your inadvertency, or has a\nMind to so resent it, but rather wonders, what god brought such civil\nGentlemen into her quarters.\"\n\nWe were silent as yet, and gave her the hearing, but inclin'd to\nNeither part of what she had said, when in came Quartilla herself\nAttended with a young girl, and sitting down by me, fell a weeping:\nNor here also did we offer a word, but stood expecting what those\nTears at command meant. At last when the showre had emptied it self\nShe disdainfully turn'd up her hood and clinching her fingers\nTogether, till the joints were ready to crack, \"What impudence,\" said\nShe, \"is this? or where learnt ye those shamms, and that slight of\nHand ye have so lately been beholding to? By my faith, young men, I\nAm sorry for ye; for no one beheld what was unlawful for him to see\nAnd went off unpunisht: and verily our part of the town has so many\nDeities, you'll sooner find a god than a man in't: And that you may\nNot think I came hither to be revenged on ye, I am more concern'd for\nYour youth, than the injury ye have done me: for unawares, as I yet\nThink, ye have committed an unexpiable abomination\n\n\"For my part it troubled me all night, and threw me into such a\nShaking, that I was afraid I had gotten a tertian, on which I took\nSomewhat to have made me sleep; but the god appeared to me, and\nCommanded me to rise and find ye out, as the likeliest way to take off\nThe violence of the fit. But I am not so much in pain for a remedy\nAs that a greater anguish strikes me to the heart, and will\nUndoubtedly make an end of me, for fear in one of your youthful\nFrolicks, you should disclose what you saw in Priapus's chappel, and\nUtter the counsels of the gods among the people. Low as your knees, I\nTherefore lift my hands t'ye, that ye neither make sport of our\nNight-worship, nor dishonour the mysteries of so many years, which\n'tis not every one, even among our selves, that knows.\"\n\nAfter this she fell a crying again, and with many a pittiful groan\nFell flat on my bed: when I at the same time, between pity and fear\nBid her take courage and assure her self of both; for that we would\nNeither divulge those holy mysteries; nor if the god had prescribed\nHer any other remedy fot her ague, be wanting our selves to assist\nProvidence, even with our own hazard\n\nAt this promise of mine, becoming more chearful, she fell a kissing me\nThick and threefold, and turning the humour of tears into laughing\nShe comb'd up some hair that hung over my face with her fingers, and\n\"I come to a truce with ye,\" said she, \"and discharge ye of the\nProcess I intended against you: but if ye shou'd refuse me the\nMedicine I entreat of ye for the ague, I have fellows enough will be\nReady by to morrow, that shall both vindicate my reputation, and\nRevenge the affront ye put upon me\n\n\"Contempt's dishono'rable, and the giver rude\nT'advise the doctor, speaks the patient proud:\nBut l am mistress of my self so far\nI can pay scorn with scorn without a war:\nThe wise revenge is to neglect the ill\nThey're not the only conquerours that kill.\"\n\nThen clapping her hands together, she turn'd off to so violent a\nLaughter, that made us apprehensive of some design against us; the\nSame also did the woman that came in first, and the girl that came\nWith her; but so mimically, that seeing no reason for so sudden a\nChange, we one while star'd on one another, and otherwhile on the\nWoman\n\nAt length, quoth Quartilla, \"I have commanded, that no flesh alive be\nSuffered to come into this inn to day; that I may receive from you the\nMedicine for the ague without interruption.\"\n\nAt what time Ascyltos was a little amaz'd, and I so chill'd that I had\nNot power to utter a word: But the company gave me heart not to expect\nWorse, for they were but three women, and if they had any design, must\nYet be too weak to effect it against us, who if we had nothing more of\nMan about us, had yet that figure to befriend us: We were all girt up\nFor the purpose, and I had so contriv'd the couples, that if it must\nCome to a rancounter, I was to make my part good with Quartilla\nAscyltos with her woman, and Gito the girl\n\nWhile I was thus casting the matter in my head, Quartilla came up to\nMe, to cure me of the ague, but finding her self disappointed, flew\nOff in a rage, and returning in a little while, told us, there were\nCertain persons unknown, had a design upon us, and therefore commanded\nTo remove us into a noble palace\n\nHere all our courage fail'd us, and nothing but certain death seem'd\nTo appear before us\n\nThen I began, \"If, madam, you design to be more severe with us, be yet\nSo kind as to dispatch it quickly; for whate'er our offence be, it is\nNot so hainous that we ought to be rack'd to death for it\": Upon which\nHer woman, whose name was Psyche, spread a coverlet on the floor\nSollicitavit inguina mea mille iam mortibus frigida. Ascyltos muffled\nHis head in his coat, as having had a hint given him, how dangerous it\nWas to take notice of what did not concern him. In the mean time\nPsyche took off her garters, and with one of them bound my feet, and\nWith the other my hands\n\nThus fetter'd as I lay, \"This, madam,\" said I, \"is not the way to rid\nYou of your ague.\" \"I grant it,\" answer'd Psyche, \"but I have a Dose\nAt hand will infallibly do it\" and therefore brought me a lusty bowl\nOf satyricon, (a love-potion) and so merrily ran over the wonderful\nEffects of it, that I had well-nigh suck'd it all off; but because\nAscyltos had slighted her courtship, she finding his back towards her\nThrew the bottom of it on him\n\nAscyltos perceiving the chat was at an end, \"Am not I worthy,\" said\nHe, \"to get a sup?\" And Psyche fearing my laughter might discover\nHer, clapped her hands, and told him, \"Young-man I made you an offer\nOf it, but your friend here has drunk it all out.\"\n\n\"Is it so,\" quoth Quartilla, smiling very agreeably, \"and has\nErcolpius gugg'd it all down?\" At last also even Gito laught for\nCompany, at what time the young wench flung her arms about his neck\nAnd meeting no resistance, half smother'd him with kisses\n\nWe would have cry'd out, but there was no one near to help us; and as\nI was offering to bid 'em keep the peace, Psyche fell a nipping and\nPricking me with her bodkin: on the other side also, the young wench\nHalf stifled Ascyltos with a dish-clout she had rubb'd in the bowl\n\nLastly came leaping upon us a burdash, in a rough mantle stuck with\nMyrtle, girt about him; and one while almost ground our hipps to\nPowder with his bobbing at us, and other while slobber'd us with his\nNasty kisses; till Quartilla, holding her staff of office in her hand\nDischarg'd us of the service; but not without having first taken an\nOath of us, that so dreadful a secret should go no further than our\nSelves. Then came in a company of wrestlers, and rubb'd us over with\nThe yolk of an egg beaten to oil: When being somewhat refresh'd, we\nPut on our right gowns, and were led into the next room, that had\nThree beds in it, all well appointed, and the rest of the\nEntertainment as splendidly set out. The word was given, and we sate\nDown, when having whet our appetites with an excellent antipast, we\nSwill'd our selves with the choicest of wine; nor was it long e'er we\nFell a nodding. \"It is so,\" quoth Quartilla; \"can ye sleep when ye\nKnow it is the vigil to Priapus?\" at what time Ascyltos snor'd so\nSoundly, that Psyche, not yet forgeting the disapointment, he gave\nHer, all besooted his face, and scor'd down his shoulders with a burnt\nSticks end\n\nPlagu'd with these mischiefs, I hardly got the least wink of sleep\nNor was the whole family, whether within doors or without, in a much\nBetter condition, some lay up and down at our feet, others had run\nTheir heads against the walls, and others lay dead asleep cross the\nThreshold: The lamps also having drunk up their oil, gave a thin and\nLast blaze\n\nAt this instant got in a couple of pilfering rogues to have stollen\nOur wine; but while they fell a scuffling among some silver vessels\nThat stood upon the table, they broke the earthen pot that held the\nWine, and overthrew the table, with the plate on it, and at the same\nTime also, a cup falling off the shelf on Psyche's bed, broke her head\nAs she lay fast asleep; on which he cry'd out, and therewith\nDiscovered the thieves, and wak'd some of the drunkards: The thieves\nOn the other hand finding themselves in a pound, threw themselves on\nOne of the beds, as some of the guests, and fell a snoring like the\nRest. The usher of the hall being by this time got awake, put some\nMore oil in the dying lamps; and the boys, having rubb'd their eyes\nReturn'd to their charge, when in came a woman that play'd on the\nHarp, and ratling its strings, rous'd all the rest: On which the\nBanquet was renew'd, and Quartilla gave the word, to go on where we\nLeft (that is drinking): The she harper also added not a little to our\nMidnight revel\n\nAt last bolted in a shameless rascal, one of no grace either in words\nOr gesture, and truly worthy of the house where he was; he also set up\nHis voice, 'till apishly composing himself, as if he intended somewhat\nTo the company, he mouth'd out these verses:\n\nO yes! Now tumblers with your wanton tricks\nMake haste, move your legs quick, make the ground drum;\nWith wanton arms, soft thighs, and active hips\nThe old, the tender, and the sweetly young\n\nConsumptis versibus suis immundissimo me basio conspuit. Mox et super\nLectum venit atque omni vi detexit recusantem. Super inguina mea diu\nMultumque frustea moluit. Profluebant per frontem sudantem acaciae\nRivi, et inter rugas malarum tantum erat cretae, ut putares detectum\nParictum nimbo laborare. Non tenui ego diutius lacrimas, sed ad\nUltiman, perductus tristitiam. \"Quaeso,\" inquam, \"domina, certe\nEmbasicoetan iusseras dari.\" Complosit illa tenerius manus et \"O\"\nInquit \"homincm acutum atque urbanitatis vernaculae fontem. Quid? tu\nNon intellexeras cinaedum embasicoetan vocari?\" Deinde ut\nContubernali meo melius succederet, \"Per fidem\" inquam \"vestram\nAscyltos in hoc triclinio solus ferias aglt?\" \"Ita\" inquit Quartilla\n\"et Ascylto embasicoetas detur.\" Ab hoc voce equum cinaedus mutavit\nTransituque ad comitem meum facto clunibus eutn basiisque distrivit\nStabat inter haec Giton et risu disolvebat ilia sua. Itaque\nConspicata eum Quartilla, cuius esset puer, diligentissima\nSciscitatione quaesivit. Cum ego fratrem meum esse dixissem, \"Quare\nErgo\" inquit \"me non basiavit?\" Vocatumque ad se in osculum\nApplicuit. Mox manum etiam demisit in sinum et pertrectato vasculo\nTam rudi \"Haec\" inquit \"belle cras in promulside libidinis nostrae\nMilitabit: hodie enim post asellum diari non sumo.\" With that Psyche\nCame tittering to her, and having whispered I know not what in her\nEar, Thou art in the right, quoth Quartilla, 'twas well thought on;\nAnd since we have so fine an opportunity, why should not our Pannychis\nLose her maidenhead? And forthwith was brought in a pretty young\nGirl, that seem'd not to be above seven years of age, and was the same\nThat first came into our room with Quartilla: All approv'd it with a\nGeneral clap, ard next desiring it, a wedding was struck up between\nThe boy and her. For my part I stood amaz'd, and assur'd them, that\nNeither Gito, a bashful lad, was able for the drudgery, nor the girl\nOf years to receive it. \"Ita,\" inquit Quartilla, \"minor eat ista quam\nEgo fui, quum primum virum passa sum? Iunonem meam iratam habeam, si\nUmquam me meminerim virginem fuisse. Nam et infans cum paribus\nInclinata sum, et subinde procedentibus annis maioribus me pueris\nApplicui, donec ad hanc aetatem perveni. Hinc etiam puto proverbium\nNatum illud, ut dicatur posse taurum tollere, qui vitulum sustulerit.\"\n\nLeast therefore my comrade might run a greater hazard, I got up to the\nWedding\n\nAnd now Psyche put a flame-colour veil on the girl's head; the pathick\nLed before with a flamboe, and a long train of drunken women, fell a\nShouting, and drest up the bride-chamber; Quartilla, all a-gog as the\nRest, took hold of Gito and dragg'd him in with her: But truly the boy\nMade no resistance; nor seem'd the girl frighted at the name of\nMatrimony. When therefore they were lockt up, we sat without, before\nThe threshold of the chamber; and Quartilla having waggishly slit a\nChink thro' the door, as wantonly laid an ape's eye to it; nor content\nWith that, pluck't me also to see that childs play, and when we were\nNot peeping, would turn her lips to me, and steal a kiss\n\nThe jade's fulsomeness had so tir'd me that I began to devise which\nWas to get off. I told Ascyltos my mind, and he was well pleased with\nIt, for he was a willing to get rid of his torment, Psyche: Nor was it\nHard to be done, if Gito had not been lockt up in the chamber; for we\nWere resolved to take him with us, and not leave him the mercy of a\nBawdy-house. While we were contriving how to effect it, it so\nHappened that Pannychis fell out of bed, and drew Gito after her\nWithout any hurt, though the girl got a small knock in the fall, and\nTherewith made such a cry, that Quartilla, all in a fright, ran\nHeadlong in, and gave us the opportunity of getting off, and taking\nThe boy with us; when without more ado, we flew to our inn, and\nGetting to bed, past the rest of the night without fear\n\nBut going out the next day, whom should we meet but two of those\nFellows that robb'd us of the mantle, which Ascyltos perceiving, he\nBriskly attack'd one of them, and having disarm'd and desperately\nWounded him, came in to my relief; who was pressing upon the other\nBut he behav'd himself so well, that he wounded us both, altho' but\nSlightly, and got off himself without so much as a scratch\n\nAnd now came the third day, that is the expectation of an\nEntertainment at Trimalchio's, where every one might speak what he\nWould: But having received some wounds, we thought flight might be of\nMore use to us than sitting still: We got to our inn therefore, as\nFast as we could, and our wounds not being great, cured them as we lay\nIn bed, with wine and oyl\n\nBut the rogue whom Ascyltos had hewn down, lay in the street, and we\nWere in fear of being discovered, while therefore we were pensively\nConsidering which way to avoid the impending storm, a servant of\nAgamemnon's interrupted our fears: \"And do not ye know,\" said he\n\"with whom we eat to-day? Trimalchio, a trim finical humorist has a\nClock in his dining-room, and one on purpose to let him know how many\nMinutes of his life he had lost.\" We therefore drest our selves\nCarefully, and Gito willingly taking upon him the part of a servant\nAs he had hither to done, we bade him put our things together, and\nFollow us to the bath\n\nBeing in the mean time got ready, we walk'd we knew not where, or\nRather, having a mind to divert us, struck into a tennis-court, where\nWe saw an old bald-pated fellow in a carnation-colour'd coat, playing\nAt ball with a company of boys, nor was it so much the boys, tho' it\nWas worth our while, that engaged us to be lookers on as the master of\nThe house himself in pumps, who altogether tossed the ball, and never\nStruck it after it once came to the ground, but had a servant by him\nWith a bag full of them, ard enough for all that play'd\n\nWe observed also some new things; for in the gallery stood two\nEunuchs, one of whom held a silver chamber-pot, the other counted the\nBalls, not those they kept tossing, but such as fell to the ground\nWhile we admir'd the humour, one Menelaus came up to us, and told us\nWe were come where we must set up for the night, and we had seen the\nBeginning of our entertainment. As he was yet talking, Trimalchio\nSnapp'd his fingers, at which sign the eunuch held the chamber-pot to\nHim as he was playing; then calling for water, he dipped the tips of\nHis fingers in it, and dry'd them on the boys head. 'Twould be too\nLong to recount every thing: We went into the hot-house, and having\nSweated a little, into the cold bath; and while Trimalchio was\nAnointed from head to foot with a liquid perfume, and rubb'd clean\nAgain, not with linnen but with finest flannen, his three chyrurgeons\nPly'd the muscadine, but brawling over their cups; Trimalchio said it\nWas his turn to drink; then wrapt in a scarlet mantle, he was laid on\nA litter born by six servants, with four lacqueys in rich liveries\nRunning before him, and by his side a sedan, in which was carried his\nDarling, a stale bleer-eyed catamite, more ill-favoured than his\nMaster Trimalchio; who at they went on, kept close to his ear with a\nFlagellet as if he had whispered him, and made him musick all the way\nWondering, we followed, and, with Agamemnon, came to the gate, on\nWhich hung a tablet with this inscription:\n\nWHAT EVER SERVANT GOES FORTH WITHOUT HIS MASTER'S COMMAND, HE SHALL\nRECEIVE AN HUNDRED STRIPES\n\nIn the porch stood the porter in a green livery, girt about with a\nCherry-coloured girdle, garbling of pease in a silver charger; and\nOver head hung a golden cage with a magpye in it, which gave us an All\nHail as we entred: But while I was gaping at these things, I had like\nTo have broken my neck backward, for on the left hand, not far from\nThe porter's lodge, there was a great dog in a chain painted on the\nWall, and over him written in capital letters, BEWARE THE DOG. My\nCompanions could not forbear laughing; bur I recollecting my spirits\nPursued my design of going to the end of the wall; it was the draught\nOf a market-place where slaves were bought and sold with bills over\nThem: There was also Trimalchio with a white staff in his hand, and\nMinerva with a train after her entring Rome: Then having learnt how to\nCast accompt, he was made auditor; all exquisitely painted with their\nProper titles; and at the end of the gallery Mercury lifting him by\nThe chin, and placing him on a judgment-seat. Fortune stood by him\nWith a cornucopia, and the three fatal sisters winding a golden\nThread\n\nI observed also in the same place a troop of light-horsemen, with\nTheir commander exercising them, as also a large armory, in one of the\nAngles of which stood a shrine with the gods of the house in silver, a\nMarble statue of Venus, and a large golden box, in which it was said\nHe kept the first shavings of his beard. Then asking the servant that\nHad the charge of these things, what pictures those were in the\nMiddle? The Iliads and the Odysses, said he, and on the left-hand two\nSpectacles of sword-playing. We could not bestow much time on it, for\nBy this time we were coming to the dining-room, in the entry of which\nSate his steward, taking every one's account: But what I most admir'd\nWere those bundles of rods, with their axes, that were fastned to the\nSides of the door, and stood, as it were, on the brazen prow of a\nShip, on which was written\n\nTO CAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO OF PR\u00c3\u2020TORIAN DIGNITY; CINNAMUS THE\nSTEWARD\n\nUnder the same title also, hung a lamp of two lights from the roof of\nThe room, and two tablets on either side of the door; of which one, if\nI well remember, had this inscription\n\nTHE THIRD AND SECOND OF THE KALENDS OF JANUARY, OUR PATRON CAIUS EATS\nABROAD\n\nOn the other was represented the course of the moon, and the seven\nStars; and what days were lucky, what unlucky, with an emboss'd studd\nTo distinguish the one from the other\n\nFull of this sensuality we were now entring the room, where one of his\nBoys, set there for that purpose, call'd aloud to us, \"ADVANCE\nORDERLY.\" Nor is it to be doubted, but we were somewhat concern'd for\nFear of breaking the orders of the place. But while we were footing\nIt accordingly, a servant stript off his livery, fell at our feet, and\nBesought us to save him a whipping; for he said his fault was no great\nMatter, but that some cloaths of the stewards had been stolen from him\nIn the bath, and all of them not worth eighteen-pence\n\nWe returned therefore in good order, and finding the steward in the\nCounting-house telling some gold, besought him to remit the servant's\nPunishment: When putting on an haughty face, \"It is not,\" said he\n\"the loss of the thing troubles me, but the negligence of a careless\nRascal. He has lost me the garments I sate at table in, and which a\nClient of mine presented me on my birth-day: no man can deny them to\nBe right purple, tho' not double dye; yet whatever it be, I grant your\nRequest.\"\n\nHaving receiv'd so great a favour, as we were entring the dining-room\nThe servant for whom we had been suitors, met us, and kissing us, who\nStood wondring what the humour meant, over and over gave us thanks for\nOur civility; and in short told us we should know by and by, whom it\nWas we had oblig'd: The wine which our master keeps for his own\nDrinking, is the waiters kindness\n\nAt length we sate down, when a bigger and sprucer sort of boys coming\nAbout us, some of them poured snow-water on our heads, and others\nPar'd the nails of our feet, with a mighty dexterity, and that not\nSilently, but singing as it were by the bye: I resolved to try if the\nWhole family sang; and therefore called for drink, which one of the\nBoys a readily brought me with an odd kind of tune; and the same did\nEvery one as you asked for any thing: You'd have taken it for a Morris\nDancers hall, not the table of a person of quality\n\nThen came a sumptuous antepast; for we were all seated, but only\nTrimalchio, for whom, after a new fashion, the chief place was\nReserv'd. Besides that, as a part of the entertainment, there was set\nBy us a large vessel of metheglin, with a pannier, in the one part of\nWhich were white olives, in the other black; two broad platters\nCovered the vessel, on the brims of which were engraven Trimalchio's\nName, and the weight of the silver, with little bridges soldered\nTogether, and on them dormice strew'd over with honey and poppy: There\nWere also piping-hot sausages on a silver gridiron, and under that\nLarge damsons, with the kernels of pomegranats\n\nIn this condition were we when Trimalchio himself was waddled into the\nConsort; and being close bolster'd with neck-cloaths and pillows to\nKeep off the air, we could not forbear laughing unawares: For his bald\nPate peep'd out of a scarlet mantle, and over the load of cloaths he\nLay under, there hung an embroidered towel, with purple tassels and\nFringes dingle dangle about it: He had also on the little finger of\nHis left hand, a large gilt ring, and on the outmost joint of the\nFinger next it, one lesser, which I took for all gold; but at last it\nAppeared to be jointed together with a kind of stars of steel. And\nThat we might see these were not all his bravery, he stripp'd his\nRight arm, on which he wore a golden bracelet, and an ivory circle\nBound together with a glittering locket and a meddal at the end of it:\nThen picking his teeth with a silver pin, \"I had not, my friends,\"\nSaid he, \"any inclination to have come among you so soon, but fearing\nMy absence might make you wait too long, I deny'd myself my own\nSatisfaction; however suffer me to make an end of my game\": There\nFollowed him a boy with an inlaid table and christal dice; and I took\nNotice of one thing more pleasant than the rest; for instead of black\nAnd white counters, his were all silver and gold pieces of money\n\nIn the mean time while he was squandering his heap at play, and we\nWere yet picking a relish here and there, a cupboard was brought in\nWith a basket, in which was a hen carved in wood, her wings lying\nRound and hollow, as sitting on brood; when presently the consort\nStruck up, and two servants fell a searching the straw under her, and\nTaking out some peahens eggs, distributed them among the company: At\nThis Trimalchio changing countenance, \"I commanded my friends,\" said\nHe \"the hen to be set with peahens eggs; and so help me Hercules, am\nAfraid they may be half hatcht: however we'll try if they are yet\nSuppable.\"\n\nThe thing we received was a kind of shell of at least six pounds\nWeight, made of paste, and moulded into the figure of an egg, which we\nEasily broke; and for my part, I was like to have thrown away my\nShare; for it seemed to me to have a chick in it; till hearing an old\nGuest of the tables saying, it was some good bit or other, I searched\nFurther into it, and found a delicate fat wheatear in the middle of a\nWell-pepper'd yolk: On this Trimalchio stopped his play for a while\nAnd requiring the like for himself, proclaim'd, if any of us would\nHave any more metheglin, he was at liberty to take it; when of a\nSudden the musick gave the sign, and the first course was scrabled\nAway by a company of singers and dancers; but in the rustle it\nHappening that a dish fell on the door, a boy took it up, and\nTrimalchio taking notice of it, pluck'd him by the ears, and commanded\nHim to throw it down again; on which the groom of the chamber came\nWith a broom and swept away the silver dish, with whatsoever else had\nFallen from the table\n\nWhen presently came in two long-hair'd blacks, with small leather\nBottles, such as with which they strew sand on the stage, and gave us\nWine to wash our hands, but no one offered us water. We all admiring\nThe finicalness of the entertainment, \"Mars,\" said he, \"is a lover of\nJustice, and therefore let every one have a table to himself, for\nHaving more elbow-room, these nasty stinking boys will be less\nTroublesome to us\"; and thereupon large double-eared vessels of glass\nClose plaistered over, were brought up with labels about their necks\nUpon which was this inscription:\n\nOPIMIAN MUSCADINE OF AN HUNDRED YEARS OLD\n\nWhile we were reading the titles, Trimalchio clapped his hands, and\n\"Alas, alas,\" said he, \"that wine should live longer than man! Wine\nIs life, and we'll try if it has held good ever since the consulship\nOf Lucius Opimius, or not. 'Tis right Opimian, and therefore make\nReady; I brought not out so good yesterday, yet there were persons of\nBetter quality sup'd with me.\"\n\nWe drank and admired every thing, when in came a servant with a silver\nPuppet, so jointed and put together that it turned every way; and\nBeing more than once thrown upon the table, cast it self into several\nFigures; on which Trimalchio came out with his poetry:\n\nUnhappy mortals, on how fine a thread\nOur lives depend! How like this puppet man\nShall we alas! be all when we are dead!\nTherefore let's live merrily while we can\n\nThe applause we gave him, was followed with a service, but respecting\nThe place not so considerable as might have been expected: However\nThe novelty of the thing drew every man's eye upon it; it was a large\nCharger, with the twelve signs round it; upon every one of which the\nMaster cook had laid somewhat or other suitable to the sign. Upon\nAries, chick-pease, (a pulse not unlike a ram's head); upon Taurus a\nPiece of beef; upon Gemini a pair of pendulums and kidneys; upon\nCancer a coronet; upon Leo an African figg; upon Virgo a well-grown\nBoy; upon Libra a pair of scales, in one of which was a tart, in the\nOther a custard; upon Scorpio a pilchard; upon Sagittary a grey-hound;\nUpon Capricorn a lobster; upon Aquarius a goose; upon Pisces two\nMullets; and in the middle a plat of herbs, cut out like a green turf\nAnd over them a honey-comb. During this, a lesser black carry'd about\nBread in a silver oven, and with a hideous voice, forced a bawdy song\nFrom a buffoon that stunk like assa f\u00c5\u201ctida\n\nWhen Trimalchio perceived we look'd somewhat awkwardly on such course\nFare, \"Come, come,\" said he, \"fall to and eat, this is the custom of\nThe place.\"\n\nNor had he sooner said it, than the fourth consort struck up; at which\nThe waiters fell a dancing, and took off the upper part of the\nCharger, under which was a dish of cramm'd fowl, and the hinder paps\nOf a sow that had farrowed but a day before, well powdered, and the\nMiddle a hare, stuck in with finns of fish in his side, that he look'd\nLike a flying horse; and on the sides of the fish four little images\nThat spouted a relishing sauce on some fish that lay near them, all of\nThem brought from the river Euripus\n\nWe also seconded the shout begun by the family, and fell merrily\nAboard this; and Trimalchio no less pleas'd than our selves, cryed\n\"Cut\"; at which the musick sounding again, the carver humour'd it, and\nCut up the meat with such antick postures, you'd have thought him a\nCarman fighting to an organ\n\nNevertheless Trimalchio in a lower note, cryed out again \"Cut:\" I\nHearing the word so often repeated, suspecting there might be some\nJoke in it, was not ashamed to ask him that sate next above me, what\nIt meant? And he that had been often present at the like, \"You see,\"\nSaid he, \"him that carves about, his name is cutter; and as often as\nHe says 'Cut,' he both calls and commands.\"\n\nThe humour spoiled my stomach for eating; but turning to him that I\nMight learn more, I made some pleasant discourse to him at a distance;\nAnd at last asked him what that woman was that so often scutled up and\nDown the room\n\n\"It is,\" said he, \"Trimalchio's wife, her name Fortunata, she measures\nMoney by the bushel; but what was she not long since? Pardon me sir\nYou would not have touch'd her with a pair of tongs, but now, no one\nKnows how, or wherefore she's got into heaven; and is Trimalchio's all\nIn all: In short, if she says it is mid-night at mid-day, he'll\nBelieve her. He's so very wealthy, he knows not what he has; but she\nHas an eye every where; and when you least think to meet her: She's\nVoid of all good counsel, and withal of all ill tongue; a very pye at\nHis bolster; whom she loves she loves; and whom she does not love, she\nDoes not love\n\n\"Then for Trimalchio, he has more lands than a crow can fly over;\nMonies upon monies: There lies more silver in his porters lodge, than\nAny one man's whole estate. And for his family, hey-day, hey-day\nThere is not (so help me Hercules) one tenth of them that know their\nMaster. In brief, there is not one of those fools about him, but he\nCan turn him into a cabbage-stalk. Nor is there any occasion to buy\nAny thing, he has all at his own door; wooll, marte, pepper, nay hens\nMilk; do but beat about and you'll find it. In a word, time was, his\nWooll was none of the best, and therefore he bought rams at Tarentum\nTo mend this breed; an in like manner he did by his honey, by bringing\nHis bees from Athens. It is not long since but he sent to the Indies\nFor mushroom-seed: Nor has he so much as a mule that did not come of a\nWild ass. See you all these quilts? there is not one of them whose\nWadding is not the finest comb'd wooll of violet or scarlet colour\nDy'd in grain. O happy man! but have a care how you put a slight on\nThose freed men, they are rich rogues: See you him that sits at the\nLower-end of the table, he has now the Lord knows what; and 'tis not\nLong since he was not worth a groat, and carried billets and faggots\nAt his back; it is said, but I know nothing of it myself, but as I\nHave heard, either he got in with an old hog-grubbler, or had to do\nWith an incubus, and found a treasure: For my part, I envy no man, (if\nGod gives anything it is a bit of a blow, and wills no evil to himself\n) he lately set up this proclamation:\n\n\"C. POMPEIUS DIOGENES HAS SOME LODGINGS\nTO LET, FOR HE HATH BOUGHT A HOUSE.\"\n\n\"But what think you of him who sits in the place of a late slave? how\nWell was he once? I do not upbraid him: He was once worth a hundred\nThousand sesterstias, but has not now a hair of his head that is not\nEngaged; nor, so help me Hercules, is it his own fault: There is not a\nBetter humour'd man than himself; but those rascally freed-men have\nCheated him of all: For know, when the pot boyls, and a man's estate\nDeclines, farewell friends. And what trade do you think he drove? He\nHad the setting forth of grave men's funerals; and with that eat like\nA prince: He had his wild boars served up covered; pastry-meats\nFowl-cooks, bakers: More wine was thrown under his table than most men\nHave in their cellars; a meer phantasm: And when his estate was going\nAnd he feared his creditors might fall upon him, he made an auction\nUnder this title:\n\n\"JULIUS PROCULUS WILL MAKE AN AUCTION\nOF SEVERAL GOODS HE HAS NO USE OF.\"\n\nThe dish was by this time taken away, and the guests grown merry with\nWine, began to talk of what was done abroad, when Trimalchio broke the\nDiscourse; and leaning on his elbow, \"This wine,\" said he, \"is worth\nDrinking, and fish must swim; but do you think I am satisfied with\nThat part of your supper you saw in the charger? Is Ulysses no better\nKnown? what then; we ought to exercise our brains as well as our\nChaps; and shew, that we are not only lovers of learning, but\nUnderstand it: Peace rest my old tutor's bones who made me a man\nAmongst men: No man can tell me any thing that is new to me; for, like\nHim, I am master of the practicks\n\n\"This heaven, that's inhabited by twelve gods, turns it self into as\nMany figures; and now 'tis Aries: He that's born under that sign has\nMuch cattle, much wooll, and to that a jolt-head, a brazen-face, and\nWill be certainly a cuckold: There are many scholars, advocates, and\nHorned beasts, come into the world under this sign. We praised our\nNativity-caster's pleasantness, and he went on then again: The whole\nHeaven is Taurus, and wonder it e'er bore foot-ball-players\nHerds-men, and such as can shift for themselves. Under Gemini are\nFoaled coach-horses, oxen calved, great baubles, and such as can claw\nBoth sides are born. I was born my self under Cancer, and therefore\nStand on many feet, as having large possessions both by sea and land\nFor Cancer suits one as well as the other, and therefore I put nothing\nUpon him, that I might not press my own geniture. Under Leo\nSpendthrifts and bullies: under Virgo, women, runagates, and such as\nWear iron garters: under Libra, butchers, slipslop-makers, and men of\nBusiness: under Scorpio, empoisoners and cut-throats: under Sagittary\nSuch as are goggle-ey'd, herb-women, and bacon-stealers: under\nCapricorn, poor helpless rascals, to whom yet Nature intended horns to\nDefend themselves: under Aquarius, cooks and paunch-bellies: under\nPisces, caterers and orators: And so the world goes round like a mill\nAnd is never without its mischief; that men be either born or perish\nBut for that tuft of herbs in the middle, and the honey-comb upon it\nI do nothing without just reason for it: Our mother the earth is in\nThe middle, made round like an egg, and has all good things in her\nSelf, like a honeycomb.\"\n\n\"Most learnedly,\" we all cry'd; and lifting our hands, swore, neither\nHipparebus nor Aratus were to be compared to him, till at last other\nServants came in and spread coverlets on the beds, on which were\nPainted nets, men in ambush with hunting-poles, and whatever\nAppertained to hunting: Nor could we yet tell what to make of it: when\nWe heard a great cry without, and a pack of beagles came and ran round\nThe table, and after them a large trey, on which was a boar of the\nFirst magnitude, with a cap on his head, (such as slaves at their\nMaking free, had set on theirs in token of liberties) on his tusks\nHung two wicker baskets, the one full of dates, the other of almonds;\nAnd about him lay little pigs of marchpane, as if they were sucking:\nThey signified a sow had farrowed, and hang there as presents for the\nGuests to carry away with them\n\nTo the cutting up this boar, here came not he that had carried about\nThe fowl as before, but a swinging fellow with a two-handed beard\nBuskins on his leggs, and a short embroidered coat; who drawing his\nWood-knife, made a large hole in the boar's side, out of which flew a\nCompany of blackbirds: Then fowlers stood ready with their engines and\nCaught them in a trice as they fluttered about the room: On which\nTrimalchio ordering to every man his bird, \"See,\" said he, \"what kind\nOf acorns this wild boar fed on:\" When presently the boys took off the\nBaskets and distributed the dates and almonds among the guests\n\nIn the mean time, I, who had private thoughts of my own, was much\nConcerned, to know why the boar was brought in with a cap upon his\nHead; and therefore having run out my tittle-tattle, I told my\nInterpreter what troubled me: To which he answered, \"Your boy can even\nTell ye what it means, for there's no riddle in it, but all as clear\nAs day. This boar stood the last of yester-nights supper, and\nDismiss'd by the guests, returns now as a free-man among us.\" I curst\nMy dulness, and asked him no more questions, that I might not be\nThought to have never eaten before with men of sense\n\nWhile we were yet talking, in came a handsome boy with a wreath of\nVine leaves and ivy about his head; declaring himself one while\nBromius, another while Lyccus, and another Euphyus (several names of\nBacchus) he carried about a server of grapes, and with a clear voice\nRepeated some of his master's poetry, at which Trimalchio turning to\nHim, \"Dionysius,\" said he, \"be thou Liber,\" (i.e.) free, (two other\nNames of Bacchus) whereupon the boy took the cap from off the boar's\nHead, and putting it on his own, Trimalchio added, \"You will not deny\nMe but I have a father, Liber.\" We all praised the conceit, and\nSoundly kissed the boy as he went round us\n\nFrom this up rose Trimalchio, and went to the close-stool; we also\nBeing at liberty, without a tyrant over us fell to some table-talk\n\nWhen presently one calling for a bumper, \"The day,\" said he, \"is\nNothing, 'tis night e're the scene turn, and therefore nothing is\nBetter than to go straight from bed to board. We have had a great\nDeal of frost, the bagnio has scarce heated me; but a warm drinking is\nMy wardrobe-keeper: For my part, I have spun this days thread; the\nWine is got into my noddle, and I am down-right--\"\n\nSelucus went on with the rest, \"And I,\" said he, \"do not bathe every\nDay, for he where I use to bathe is a fuller: Cold water has teeth in\nIt, and my head grows every day more washy than others, but when I\nHave got my dose in my guts, I bid defiance to cold: Nor could I well\nDo it to day, for I was at a funeral, a jolly companion, and a good\nMan was he, Crysanthus has breathed his last: 'Tis not long since we\nWere together, and methinks I talk with him now. Alas, alas! we are\nBut blown bladders, less than flies, yet they have somewhat in them:\nBut we are meer bubbles. You'll say he would not be rul'd; not a drop\nOf water, or crumb of bread went down his throat in five days: And yet\nHe's gone, or that he died of the doctor. But I am of opinion his\nTime was come; for a physician is a great comfort. However, he was\nWell carried out of his house upon a rich bed, and mightily lamented\nHe made some of his servants free; but his wife seem'd not much\nConcerned for him. You'll say again he was not kind to her; but women\nAre a kind of kites; whatever good is done them, 'tis the same as if\nIt were thrown in a well; and old love is as bad as a goal.\"\n\nAt this Philaos grew troublesome, and cryed out, \"Let us remember the\nLiving: He had what was due to him; as he liv'd so he dy'd; and what\nHas he now that any man moans the want of it? He came from nothing\nAnd to his dying-day would have taken a farthing from a dunghil with\nHis teeth; therefore as he grew up, he grew like a honey-comb. He\nDy'd worth the Lord knows what, all ready money. But to the matter; I\nHave eaten a dog's tongue and dare speak truth: He had a foul mouth\nWas all babble; a very make-bate, not a man. His brother was a brave\nFellow, a friend to his friends, of an open hand, and kept a full\nTable: He did not order his affairs so well at first as he might have\nDone; but the first vintage made him up again; for he sold what wine\nHe would; and what kept up his chin was the expectation of a\nReversion; the credit of which brought him more than was left him; for\nHis brother taking a pelt at him, devised the estate to I know not\nWhose bastard: He flies far that flies his relations. Besides, this\nBrother of his had whisperers about him, that were back-friends to the\nOther: but he shall never do right that is quick of belief, especially\nIn matter of business; and yet 'tis true, he'll be counted wise while\nHe lives, to whom the thing whatever it be is given, nor he that ought\nTo have had it. He was without doubt, one of fortune's sons; lead in\nHis hand would turn to gold, and without trouble too, where there are\nNot rubbs in the way. And how many years think ye he liv'd?\nSeventy-odd: but he was as hard as horn, bore his age well, and as\nBlack as a crow\n\n\"I knew him some years ago an oilman, and to his last a good womans\nMan; but withal such a miser, that (so help me Hercules) I think he\nLeft not a dogg in his house. He was also a great whore-master, and a\nJack of all trades; nor do I condemn him for't, for this was the only\nSecret he kept to himself and carry'd with him.\"\n\nThus Phileros and Gammedes, as followeth: \"Ye talk of what concerns\nNeither Heaven nor Earth, when in the mean time no man regards what\nMakes all victuals so scarce: I could not (so help me Hercules) get a\nMouthful of bread to day: and how? The drought continues: For my\nPart, I have not fill'd my belly this twelve-month: A plague on these\nClerks of the market, the baker and they juggle together; take no\nNotice of me, I'll take no notice of thee; which make the poorer sort\nLabour for nothing, while those greater jaw-bones make festival every\nDay. Oh that we had those lyons I now find here, when I first came\nOut of Asia, that had been to live: The inner part of Sicily had the\nLike of them, but they so handled the goblins, even Jupiter bore them\nNo good-will. I remember Safinius, when I was a boy, he liv'd by the\nOld arch; you'd have taken him for pepper-corn rather than a man;\nWhere-ever he went the earth parched under him; yet he was honest at\nBottom; one might depend on him; a friend to his friend, and whom you\nMight boldly trust in the dark. But how did he behave himself on the\nBench? He toss'd every one like a ball; made no starch'd speeches\nBut downright, as he were, doing himself what he would persuade\nOthers: But in the market his noise was like a trumpet, without\nSweating or spueing. I fancy he had somewhat, I know not what, of the\nAsian humour: then so ready to return a salute, and call every one by\nHis name, as if he had been one of us. In his time corn was as common\nAs loam; you might have bought more bread for half a farthing, than\nAny two could eat; but now the eye of an ox will cost you twice as\nMuch: Alas! alas! we are every day worse and worse, and grow like a\nCows tail, downward: And why all this? We have a clerk of the market\nNot worth three figgs, and values more the getting of a doit himself\nThan any of our lives: 'Tis this makes him laugh in his sleeve; for he\nGets more money in a day than many an honest man's whole estate: I\nKnow not how he got the estate he has; but if we had any thing of men\nAbout us, he would not hug himself as he does, but now the people are\nGrown to this pass, that they are lyons at home, and foxes abroad: For\nMy part, I have eaten up my cloaths already, and if corn holds at the\nRate it does, I shall be forc'd to sell house and all: For what will\nBecome of us, if neither gods nor men pity us? Let me never enjoy my\nFriends more, than I believe all this comes from Heaven; for no one\nThinks there is any such thing; no one keeps a fast, or value Jupiter\nA hair, but shuts his eyes and reckons what he is worth. Time was\nWhen matrons went bare-foot with dishevel'd hair, pure minds, and\nPray'd him to send rain, and forthwith it rained pitcher-fulls, or\nThen or never, and every one was pleased: Now the gods are no better\nThan mice; as they tread, their feet are wrapt in wooll; and because\nYe are not superstitious your lands yield nothing.\"\n\n\"More civilly, I beseech ye,\" said Echion the hundred-constable; \"it\nIs one while this way, and another while that, said the country-man\nWhen he lost his speckled hogg: What is not to day may be to morrow;\nAnd thus is life hurried about, so help me Hercules, a country is said\nNot to be the better that it has many people in it, tho' ours at\nPresent labours under that difficulty, but it is no fault of hers: We\nMust not be so nice, Heaven is equally distant every where; were you\nIn another place you'd say hoggs walked here ready dress'd: And now I\nThink on't, we shall have an excellent show these holy-days, a\nFencing-prize exhibited to the people; not of slaves bought for that\nPurpose, but most of them freemen. Our patron Titus has a large soul\nBut a very devil in his drink, and cares not a straw which side gets\nThe better: I think I should know him, for I belong to him; he's of a\nRight breed both by father and mother, no mongril. They are well\nProvided with weapons, and will fight it out to the last: the theatre\nWill look like a butchers shambles, and he has where-withal to do it;\nHis father left him a vast sum, and let him make ducks and drakes with\nIt never so much, the Estate will bear it, and he always carries the\nReputation of it. He has his waggon horses, a woman-carter, and\nGlyco's steward, who was taken a-bed with his mistress; what a busle's\nHere between cuckolds and cuckold-makers! But this Glyco a\nMoney-broker, condemned his steward to fight with beasts; and what was\nThat but to expose himself for another? where lay the servant's crime\nWho perhaps was oblig'd to do what he did: She rather deserv'd to be\nBrain'd, than the bull that tossed her; but he that cannot come at the\nArse, thrashes at the pack-saddle: yet how could Glyco expect\nHermogine's daughter should make a good end? She'd have pared the\nClaws of a flying kite; a snake does not bring forth a halter: Glyco\nMight do what he would with his own; but it will be a brand on him as\nLong as he lives; nor can any thing but Hell blot it out; however\nEvery man's faults are his own. I perceive now what entertainment\nMammea is like to give us; he'll be at twopence charges for me and my\nCompany; which if he does, he will pull Narbanus clean out of favour;\nFor you must know, he'll live at the full height; yet in truth what\nGood has he done us? He gave us a company of gittiful sword-players\nBut so old and decrepid, that had you blown on them, they'd have\nFallen of themselves: I have seen many a better at a funeral pile; he\nWould not be at the charge of lamps for them; you'd have taken them\nFor dunghil cocks fighting in the dark; one was a downright fool, and\nWithal gouty; another crump-footed, and a third half dead, and\nHamstrung: There was one of them a Thracian, that made a figure, and\nKept up to the rule of fighting; but upon the whole matter, all of\nThem were parted, and nothing came of this great block-headed rabble\nBut a downright running away: And yet, said he, I made ye a show, and\nI clap my hands for company; but cast up the account, I gave more than\nI received; one hand rubs another. You Agamemnon seem to tell me what\nWould that trouble some fellow be at; because you that can speak, and\nDo not, you are not of our form, and therefore ridicule what poor men\nSay; tho', saving the repute of a scholar, we know you are but a meer\nFool. Where lies the matter then? let me persuade you to take a walk\nIn the country, and see our cottage, you'll find somewhat to eat; a\nChicken, some eggs, or the like: The tempestuous season had like to\nHave broke us all, yet we'll get enough to fill the belly. Your\nScholar, my boy Cicero, is mightily improved, and if he lives, you'll\nHave a servant of him; he is pretty forward already, and whatever\nSpare time he has, never off a book: He's a witty lad, well-featur'd\nTakes a thing without much study, tho' yet he be sickly: I killed\nThree of his linnets the other day, and told him the weasels had eaten\nThem; yet he found other things to play with, and has a pretty knack\nAt painting: He has a perfect aversion to Greek, but seems better\nInclined to Latin; tho' the master he has now humours him in the\nOther; nor can he be kept to one thing, but is still craving more, and\nWill not take pains with any. There is also another of this sort, not\nMuch troubled with learning, but very diligent, and teaches more than\nHe knows himself: He comes to our house on holidays, and whatever you\nGive him he's contented; I therefore bought the boy some ruled books\nBecause I will have him get a smattering in accounts and the law; it\nWill be his own another day: He has learning enough already, but if he\nTakes back to it again, I design him for a trade, a barber, a parson\nOr a lawyer, which nothing but the devil can take from him: How oft\nHave I told him, Thou art (Sirrah) my first begotten, and believe thy\nFather, whatever thou learnest 'tis all thy own: See there Philero the\nLawyer, if he had not been a scholar he might have starved; but now\nSee what trinkums he has about his neck, and dares nose Narbanus\nLetters are a treasure, and a trade never dies.\"\n\nThus, or the like, we were bandying it about when Trimalchio return'd\nAnd having wip'd the slops from his face, wash'd his hands, and in a\nVery little time, \"Pardon me, my friends,\" said he, \"I have been\nCostive for several days, and my physicians were to seek about it\nWhen a suppository of pomegranate wine, with the liquor of a pine-tree\nAnd vinegar relieved me; and now I hope my belly may be ashamed if it\nKeep no better order; for otherwise I have such a rumbling in my guts\nYou'd think an ox bellowed; and therefore if any of you has a mind, he\nNeed not blush for the matter; there's not one of us born without some\nDefect or other, and I think no torment greater than wanting the\nBenefit of going to stool, which is the only thing even Jupiter\nHimself cannot prevent: And do you laugh, Fortunata, you that break me\nSo often of my sleep by nights; I never denyed any man do that in my\nRoom might pleasure himself, and physicians will not allow us to keep\nAny thing in our bodies longer than we needs must; or if ye have any\nFarther occasion, every thing is ready in the next room: Water\nChamber-pots, close-stools, or whatever else ye may need; believe me\nThis being hard-bound, if it get into the head, disturbs the whole\nBody; I have known many a man lost by it, when they have been so\nModest to themselves as not to tell what they ailed.\"\n\nWe thank'd him for his freeness, and the liberty he gave us, when yet\nTo suppress our laughter, we set the glasses about again; nor did we\nYet know that in the midst of such dainties we were, as they say, to\nClamber another hill; for the cloth being again taken away, upon the\nNext musick were brought in three fat hogs with collars and bells\nAbout their necks; and he that had the charge of them told us, the one\nWas two years old, the other three, and the third full grown. I took\nIt at first to have been a company of tumblers, and that the hogs, as\nThe manner is, were to have shewn us some tricks in a ring, till\nTrimalchio breaking my expectation, \"Which of them,\" said he, \"will ye\nHave for supper? for cocks, pheasants, and the like trifles are but\nCountry fare, but my cooks have coppers will boil a calf whole;\" and\nTherewith commanding a cook to be called for, he prevented our choice\nBy ordering him to kill the largest, and with a loud voice, asked him\nOf what rank of servants in that house he was? to which he answering\nOf the fortieth: \"Were you bought,\" said the other, \"or born in my\nHouse?\" \"Neither,\" said the cook, \"but left you by Pansa's\nTestament.\" \"See then,\" said Trimalchio, \"that you dress it as it\nShould be, or I'll send you to the galleys.\" On which the cook\nAdvertised of his power, went into the kitchin to mind his charge\n\nBut Trimalchio turning to us with a pleasanter look, asked if the wine\nPleased us, \"If not,\" said he, \"I'll have it changed, and if it does\nLet me see it by your drinking: I thank the gods I do not buy it, but\nHave everything that may get an appetite growing on my own grounds\nWithout the city, which no man that I know but my self has; and yet it\nHas been taken for Tarracino and Taranto. I have a project to joyn\nSicily to my lands on the continent, that when I have a mind to go\nInto Africa, I may sail by my own coasts. But prithee Agamemnon tell\nMe what moot-point was it you argued to day; for tho' I plead no\nCauses my self, yet I have had a share of letters in my time; and that\nYou may not think me sick of them now, have three libraries, the one\nGreek, the other two Latin; therefore as you love me tell me what was\nThe state of the question:\" \"The poor and the rich are enemies,\" said\nAgamemnon: \"And what is poor,\" answered Trimalchio? \"Spoke like a\nGentleman,\" replyed Agamemnon. But making nothing of the matter, \"If\nIt be so,\" said Trimalchio, \"where lies the dispute? And if it be not\nSo, 'tis nothing.\"\n\nWhile we all humm'd this and the like stuff, \"I beseech ye,\" said he\n\"my dear Agamemnon, do you remember the twelve labours of Hercules, or\nThe story of Ulysses, how a Cyclop put his thumb out of joint with a\nMawkin? I read such things in Homer when I was a boy; nay, saw my\nSelf the Sybil of Curna hanging in a glass bottle: And when the boys\nAsked her, 'Sybil, what wouldst thou?' She answered, 'I would die.'\"\n\nHe had not yet run to the end of the rope, when an over-grown hog was\nBrought to the table. We all wondered at the quickness of the thing\nAnd swore a capon could not be dress'd in the time; and that the more\nBecause the hog seemed larger than was the boar, we had a little\nBefore: When Trimalchio looking more intent upon him, \"What, what,\"\nSaid he, \"are not his guts taken out? No, (so help me Hercules) they\nAre not! Bring hither, bring hither this rogue of a cook.\" And when\nHe stood hanging his head before us, and said, he was so much in haste\nHe forgot it. \"How, forgot it,\" cry'd out Trimalchio! \"Do ye think\nHe has given it no reasoning of pepper and cummin? Strip him:\" When\nIn a trice 'twas done, and himself set between two tormentors:\nHowever, we all interceded for him, as a fault that might now and then\nHappen, and therefore beg'd his pardon; but if he ever did the like\nThere was no one would speak for him; tho' for my part, I think he\nDeserved what he got: And so turning to Agamemnon's ear, \"This\nFellow,\" said I, \"must be a naughty knave; could any one forget to\nBowel a hog? I would not (so help me Hercules) have forgiven him if\nHe had served me so with a single fish.\" But Trimalchio it seems, had\nSomewhat else in his head; for falling a laughing, \"You,\" said he\n\"that have so short a memory, let's see if you can do it now.\" On\nWhich, the cook having gotten his coat again, took up a knife, and\nWith a feigned trembling, ripp'd up the hog's belly long and thwart\nWhen immediately its own weight tumbled out a heap of hogs-puddings\nAnd sausages\n\nAfter this, as it had been done of it self, the family gave a shout\nAnd cry'd out, \"Health and prosperity to Caius!\" The cook also was\nPresented with wine, a silver coronet, and a drinking goblet, on a\nBroad Corinthian plate: which Agamemnon more narrowly viewing; \"I am,\"\nSaid Trimalchio, ''the only person that has the true Corinthian\nVessels.\"\n\nI expected, that according to the rest of his haughtiness, he would\nHave told us they had been brought him from Corinth: But he better:\n\"And perhaps,\" said he, \"you'll ask me why I am the only person that\nHave them. And why, but the copper-smith from whom I buy them, is\nCalled Corinthus? And what is Corinthian but what is made by\nCorinthus? But that ye may not take me for a man of no sence, I\nUnderstand well enough whence the word first came. When Troy was\nTaken, Hannibal, a cunning fellow, but withal mischievous, made a pile\nOf all the brazen, gold and silver statues, and burnt them together\nAnd thence came this mixt metal; which workmen afterwards carried off;\nAnd of this mass made platters, dishes, and several other things; so\nThat these vessels are neither this nor that metal, but made of all of\nThem. Pardon me what I say; however others may be of another mind, I\nHad rather have glass ware; and if it: were not so subject to\nBreaking, I'd reckon it before gold; but now it is of no esteem\n\n\"There was a copper-smith that made glass vessels of that pliant\nHarness, that they were no more to be broken than gold and silver\nOnes: It so happened, that having made a drinking-pot, with a wide\nMouth of that kind, but the finest glass, fit for no man, as he\nThought, less than C\u00c3\u00a6sar himself; he went with his present to\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar, and had admittance: The kind of the gift was praised, the\nHand of the workman commended, and the design of the giver accepted\nHe again, that he might turn the admiration of the beholders into\nAstonishment, and work himself the more into the Emperor's favour\nPray'd the glass out of the Emperor's hand; and having received it\nThrew it with such a force against the paved floor, that the most\nSolid and firmest metal could not but have received some hurt thereby\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar also was no less amazed at it, than concerned for it; but the\nOther took up the pot from the ground, not broken but bulg'd a little;\nAs if the substance of metal had put on the likeness of a glass; and\nTherewith taking a hammer out of his pocket, he hammer'd it as it had\nBeen a brass kettle, and beat out the bruise: And now the fellow\nThought himself in Heaven, in having, as he fansied, gotten the\nAcquaintance of C\u00c3\u00a6sar, and the admiration of all: But it fell out\nQuite contrary: C\u00c3\u00a6sar asking him if any one knew how to make this\nMalleable glass but himself? And he answering, there was not, the\nEmperor commanded his head to be struck off: 'For,' said he, 'if this\nArt were once known, gold and silver will be of no more esteem than\nDirt.'\n\n\"And for silver, I more than ordinarily affect it: I have several\nWater-pots more or less, whereon is the story how Cassandra killed her\nSon's, and the dead boys are so well embossed, you'd think them real\nI have also a drinking cup left me by an advocate of mine, where\nD\u00c3\u00a6dalus puts Niobe into the Trojan horse, as also that other of\nHermerotes; that they may stand as a testimony, there's truth in cups\nAnd all this massy; ror will I part with what I understand of them at\nAny rate.\"\n\nWhile he was thus talking, a cup dropt out of a boy's hand; on which\nTrimalchio looking over his shoulder at him, bad him begone, and kill\nHimself immediately; \"for,\" said he, \"thou art careless and mind'st\nNot what thou art about.\" The boy hung his lip, and besought him; but\nHe said, \"What! dost thou beseech me, as if I required some difficult\nMatter of thee? I only bid thee obtain this of thy self, that thou be\nNot careless again.\" But at last he discharged him upon our entreaty\nOn this the boy run round the table and cry'd, \"Water without doors\nAnd wine within.\" We all took the jest, but more especially\nAgamemnon, who knew on what account himself had been brought thither\n\nTrimalchio in the mean time hearing himself commended, drank all the\nMerrier, and being within an ace of quite out, \"Will none of you,\"\nSaid he, \"invite my Fortunata to dance? Believe me, there's no one\nLeads a country dance better:\" And with that, tossing his hands round\nHis head, fell to act a jack-pudding; the family all the while\nSinging, 'youth it self, most exactly youth it self ;' and he had\nGotten into the middle of the room, but that Fortunata whispered him\nAnd I believe told him, such gambols did not become his gravity. Nor\nWas there any thing more uneven to it self; for one while he turned to\nHis Fortunata, and another while to his natural inclination: But what\nDisturbed the pleasure of her dancing, was his notaries coming in;\nWho, as they had been the acts of a common council, read aloud:\n\n'VII. of the Calends of August born in Trimalchio's manner of cumanum\nThirty boys and forty girls, brought from the threshing-floor into the\nGranary, five hundred thousand bushels of wheat. The same day broke\nOut a fire in a pleasure-garden that was Pompey's, first began in one\nOf his bayliffs houses.'\n\n\"How's this,\" said Trimalchio: \"When were those gardens bought for\nMe?\" \"The year before,\" answered his notary, \"and therefore not yet\nBrought to account.\"\n\nAt this Trimalchio fell into a fume; and \"whatever lands,\" said he\n\"shall be bought me hereafter, if I hear nothing of it in six months\nLet them never, I charge ye, be brought to any account of mine.\" Then\nAlso were read the orders of the clerks of the markets, and the\nTestaments of his woodwards, rangers, and park-keepers, by which they\nDisinherited their relations, and with ample praise of him, declare\nTrimalchio their heir. Next that, the names of his bayliffs; and how\nOne of them that made his circuits in the country, turned off his wife\nFor having taken her in bed with a barber; the door-keeper of his\nBaths turn'd out of his place; the auditor found short in his\nAccounts, and the dispute between the grooms of his chamber ended\n\nAt last came in the dancers on the rope, and a gorbelly'd blockhead\nStanding out with a ladder, commanded his boy to hopp every round\nSinging, and dance a jigg on the top of it, and then tumble through\nBurning hoops of iron, with a glass in his mouth. Trimalchio was the\nOnly person that admir'd it, but withal said, he did not like it; but\nThere were two things he could willingly behold, and they were the\nFlyers on the high rope, and quails; and that all other creatures and\nShows were meer gewgaws: \"For,\" said he, \"I bought once a sett of\nStroulers, and chose rather to make them merry-andrews than comedians;\nAnd commanded my bag-piper to sing in Latin to them.\"\n\nWhile he was chattering all at this rate, a boy chanced to stumble\nUpon him, on which the family gave a shriek, the same also did the\nGuests; not for such a beast of a man, whose neck they could willingly\nHave seen broken, but for fear the supper should break up ill, and\nThey be forc'd to wail the death of the boy\n\nWhatever it were, Trimalchio gave a deep groan; and leaning upon his\nArm as if it had been hurt, the physicians ran thick about him, and\nWith the first, Fortunata, her hair about her ears, a bottle of wine\nIn her hand, still howling, miserable unfortunate woman that she was!\nUndone, undone. The boy on the other hand, ran under our feet, and\nBeseeched us to procure him a discharge: But I was much concern'd\nLest our interposition might make an ill end of the matter; for the\nCook that had forgotten to bowel the hog was still in my thoughts. I\nBegan therefore to look about the room, for fear somewhat or other\nMight drop through the ceiling; while the servant that had bound up\nHis arm in white, not scarlet-colour flannen, was soundly beaten: Now\nWas I much out, for instead of another course, came in an order of\nTrimalchio's by which he gave the boy his freedom; that it might not\nBe said, so honourable a person had been hurt by his slave. We all\nCommended the action, but chatted among our selves with what little\nConsideration the things of this world were done. \"You're in the\nRight,\" said Trimalchio; \"nor ought this accident to pass without\nBooking;\" and so calling for the journal, commanded it to be entered;\nAnd with, as little thought, tumbled out these verses:\n\n\"What's least expected falls into our dish\nAnd fortune's more indulgent than our wish:\nTherefore, boy, fill the generous wine about.\"\n\nThis epigram gave occasion to talk of the poets, and Marsus, the\nTrachian, carry'd the bays a long while: till Trimalchio (turning to\nSome wit amongst them) \"I beseech ye, master of mine,\" said he, \"tell\nMe what difference take ye between Cicero the orator, and Publius the\nPoet? for my part I think one was more eloquent, the other the\nHonester man; for what could be said better than this.\"\n\n\"Now sinking Rome grows weak with luxury\nTo please her appetite cram'd peacocks die:\nTheir gaudy plumes a modish dress supply\n\nFor her the guinnea hen and capon's drest:\nThe stork it self for Rome's luxurious taste\nMust in a caldron build its humbl'd nest\n\nThat foreign, friendly, pious, long-leg'd thing\nGrateful, that with shrill sounding notes dost sing\nAll winter's gone; yet ushers in the spring\nWhy in one ring must three rich pearls be worn\nBut that your wives th' exhausted seas adorn\nAbroad t' increase their lust, at home their scorn?\n\nWhy is the costly emerald so desir'd\nOr richer glittering carbuncle admir'd\nBecause they sparkle, is't with that you're fir'd?\nWell, honesty's a jewel. Now none knows\nA modest bride from a kept whore by 'er cloaths;\nFor cobweb lawns both spouse and wench expose.\"\n\n\"But, now we talk after the rate of the learned, which,\" said he, \"are\nThe most difficult trades? I think a physician and a banker: a\nPhysician, because he know's a man's very heart, and when the fits of\nAn ague will return; tho' by the way, I hate them mortally; for by\nTheir good will I should have nothing but slubber-slops: And a banker\nBecause he'll find out a piece of brass money, tho' plated with\nSilver\n\n\"There are also brute beasts, sheep and oxen, laborious in their kind:\nOxen, to whom we are beholding for the bread we eat; and sheep, for\nThe wooll, that makes us so fine. But O horrid! we both eat the\nMutton, and make us warm with the fleece. I take the bees for divine\nCreatures; they give us honey, tho' 'tis said they stole it from\nJupiter, and that's the reason why they sting: For where-ever ye meet\nAny thing that's sweet you'll ever find a sting at the end of it.\"\n\nHe also excluded philosophers from business, while the memoirs of the\nFamily were carrying round the table, and a boy, set for that purpose\nRead aloud the names of the presents, appointed for the guests, to\nCarry home with them. Wicked silver, what can it not? Then a gammon\nOf bacon was set on the table, and above that several sharp sauces, a\nNight-cap for himself, pudding-pies, and I know not what kind of\nBirds: There was also brought in a rundlet of wine, boiled off a third\nPart, and kept under ground to preserve its strength: There were also\nSeveral other things I can give no account of; besides apples\nScallions, peaches, a whip, a knife, and what had been sent him; as\nSparrows, a flye-flap, raisons, Attick honey, night-gowns, judges\nRobes, dry'd paste, table-books, with a pipe and a foot-stool: After\nWhich came in an hare and a sole-fish: And there was further sent him\nA lamprey, a water-rat, with a frog at his tail, and a bundle of\nBeets\n\nLong time we smiled at these, and five hundred the like, that have now\nSlipt my memory: But now when Ascyltos, who could not moderate\nHirnself, held up his hands and laught at every thing; nay so\nDownright, that he was ready to cry: A free-man of Trimalchio's that\nSate next above me, grew hot upon't; and \"What,\" said he, \"thou sheep\nWhat dost thou laugh at? does not this sumptuousness of my master\nPlease you? you're richer (forsooth) and eat better every day; so may\nThe guardian of this place favour me, as had I sate near him, I'd hit\nHim a box on the ear ere this: A hopeful cullion, that mocks others;\nSome pitiful night-walker, not worth the very urine he makes; and\nShould I throw mine on him, knows not where to dry himself. I am not\n(so help me Hercules) quickly angry, yet worms are bred even in tender\nFlesh. He laughs! what has he to laugh at? what wooll did his father\nGive for the bantling? Is he a Roman knight? I am the son of a king\nHow came I then, you'll say, to serve another? I did it of my self\nAnd had rather be a citizen of Rome, than a tributary king, and now\nHope to live so, as to be no man's jeast. I walk like other men, with\nAn open face, and can shew my head among the best, for I owe no man a\nGroat; I never had an action brought against me, or said to me on the\nExchange, Pay me what thou owest me. I bought some acres in the\nCountry, and have everything suitable to it: I feed twenty mouths\nBesides dogs: I ransomed my bond-woman, lest another should wipe his\nHands on her smock; and between our selves, she cost me more than I'll\nTell ye at present. I was made a captain of horse gratis, and hope so\nTo die, that I shall have no occasion to blush in my grave: But art\nThou so prying into others, that thou never considerest thy self?\nCanst thou spy a louse on another man's coat, and not see the tyck on\nThy own? Your master then is ancienter than your self, and 't please\nHim; but yet thou, whose milk is not yet out of thy nose; that can'st\nNot say boh to a goose; must you be making observations? Are you the\nWealthier man? If you are, dine twice, and sup twice; for my part, I\nValue my credit more than treasures: Upon the whole matter, where's\nThe man that ever dunn'd me twice? Thou pipkin of a man, more limber\nBut nothing better than a strap of wet leather, I have served forty\nYears in this house, came into it with my hair full grown; this palace\nWas not then built, yet I made it my business to please my master, a\nPerson of honour, the parings of whose nails are more worth than thy\nWhole body. I met several rubs in my way, but by the help of my good\nAngel, I broke through them all: This is truth; it is as easie to make\nA hunting-horn of a sow's tail, as to get into this company. What\nMake ye in a dump now, like a goat at a heap of stones?\"\n\nOn this Gito, who stood behind him, burst out a laughing; which the\nOther taking notice of, fell upon the boy; and, \"Do you,\" said he\n\"laugh too, you curl-pated chattering magpye? O the Saturnals! Why\nHow now, sirrah! is it the month of December? When were you twenty, I\nPray? What would this collop dropt from the gibbet, this crows-meat\nBe at? I'll find some or other way for Jupiter to plague thee, and\nHim that bred thee no better, or never let me eat a good meals-meat\nAgain: I could, sirrah, but for the companies sake, I spare thee; tho'\nEither we understand not aright, or they are sots themselves that\nCarry no better a hand over thee; for without doubt it is true, like\nMaster like man. I am hot by nature, and can scarce contain my self;\nGive me but a mess of peaseporridge, and I care not two-pence for my\nMother. Very well, I shall meet thee abroad, thou mouse; nay, rather\nMole-hill. May I never thrive more, but I'll drive that master of\nThine into a blade of rue; nor shalt thou (so help me Hercules) 'scape\nMe, tho' thou couldst call in Jupiter to thy aid: I shall off with\nThose locks, and take thee when that trifling master of thine shall be\nOut of the way; thou wilt certainly fall into my hands, and either I\nKnow not my self, or I'll make thee leave that buffoonry: Tho' thy\nBeard were of gold, I'll have thee bruised in a mortar, and him that\nFirst taught thee: I never studied geometry, criticism, and meer words\nWithout sence, but I understand the fitting of stones for buildings;\nCan run you over a hundred things, as to metal, weight, coin, and that\nTo a tittle; if you have a mind you and I will try it between us: I'll\nLay thee a wager, thou wizard, and tho' I am wholly ignorant of\nRhetorick, thou'lt presently see thou hast lost: Let no one run about\nThe bush to me; I come up to him: Resolve me, I say, 'which of us\nRuns, yet stirs not out of his place: which of us grows bigger, and\nYet is less.' Do you scamper? Can't you tell what to make of it, that\nYou look so like a mouse in a trap? Therefore either hold thy tongue\nOr don't provoke a better man than thy self, who does not think thee\nFram'd of nature, unless thou fansiest me taken with those yellow\nCurl'd locks, which thou hast already vowed to some whore or other. O\nLucky opportunity! Come, let's walk the exchange, and see which of us\nCan take up money: You'll be satisfied then, this iron has credit\nUpon't; a pretty thing, is it not! a drunken fox. So may I gain while\nI live, and die well; but the people will brain me if I follow not\nThat coat on thy back, which is not for thy wearing, where-ever thou\nGoest: He's a precious tool too, whoever he were, that taught thee; a\nPiece of green cheese, no master. I have learn'd as well as another\nMan, and my master said it would be my own another day. Save your\nWorship! get home as fast as you can, but look well about you, and\nHave a care how you speak irreverently of your betters, or vie estates\nWith them; he that does it, his purse shall feel it: For my self, that\nYou see me as I am, I thank my stars for the art I have.\"\n\nAscyltos was making answer to his railing; when Trimalchio, pleased\nWith that good grace of speaking, \"Go to,\" said he, \"no more of this\nWild talk, let us rather be pleasant: And you Hermeros, bear with the\nYoung-man, his blood boils; be thou the soberer man; he that is\nOvercome in this matter, goes off conqueror: Even thy self, when thou\nWert such another capon, hadst nothing but coco, coco, and no heart at\nAll. Let us therefore, which is the better of the two, be heartily\nMerry, and expect some admirers of Homer, that will be here\nPresently.\"\n\nNor were the words scarce out of his mouth, when in came a band of\nMen, and made a rustling with their spears and targets. Trimalchio\nLeaned on his pillow, the Homerists ratled out Greek verses, as\nArrogantly enough, they were won't to do, and he read a Latin book with\nA loud voice: whereupon silence being made, \"Know ye,\" said he, \"what\nFable they were upon?\n\n\"Diomedes and Ganymede were two brothers, and Helen was their sister;\nAgamemnon stole him away, and shamm'd Diana with a hind in his room\nAs says Homer in this place; and how the Trojans and the Parentines\nFought among themselves; but at last he got the better of it, and\nMarried his daughter Iphigenia to Achilles; on which Ajax run mad\nAnd there's an end of the tale.\"\n\nOn this the Homerists set up a shout, and a young boiled heifer with\nAn helmet on her head, was handed in upon a mighty charger: Ajax\nFollowed, and with a drawn sword, as if he were mad, made at it, now\nIn one place, then in another, still acting a Morris-dancer; till\nHaving cut it into joints, he took them upon the point of his sword\nAnd distributed them. Nor had we much time to admire the conceit; for\nOf a sudden the roof gave a crack, and the whole room shook: For my\nPart, I got on my feet, but all in confusion, for fear some tumbler\nMight drop on my head; the same also were the rest of the guests;\nStill gaping and expecting what new thing should come from the clouds:\nWhen straight the main beams opened, and a vast circle was let down\nAll round which hung golden garlands, and alabaster pots of sweet\nOintments\n\nWhile we were required to take up these presents, I chanced to cast an\nEye upon the table, where there lay a fresh service of cheese-cakes\nAnd tarts, and in the midst of them a lusty rundlet, stuck round with\nAll sorts of apples and grapes, as they commonly draw that figure\n\nWe greedily reached our hands towards it, when of a sudden, a new\nDiversion gave us fresh mirth; for all the cheese-cakes, apples and\nTarts, upon the least touch, threw out a delicious liquid perfurne\nWhich fell upon us\n\nWe judging the mess to be sacred, that was so gorgeously set out\nStood up and began a health to the august founder, the father of his\nCountry: After which reverence, failing to catch that catch could, we\nFilled our napkins and I chiefly, who thought nothing too good for my\nBoy Gito\n\nDuring this, in came three boys in white, their coats tuck'd about\nThem; of whom, two set on the table three household gods with broaches\nAbout their necks, and the other bearing round us a goblet of wine\nCry'd aloud, \"Be the gods favourable!\" \"The name of this,\" said he\n\"is cobler, that other's good-luck, and the third's spend-all:\" And as\nThe image of Trimalchio was carryed round, and every one kiss'd it, we\nThought it a shame not to do as the rest of the company\n\nAfter this, when all of us had wished him health and happiness\nTrimalchio, turning to Niceros, \"You were won't,\" said he, \"to be a\nGood companion, but what's the matter we get not a word from ye now?\nLet me entreat ye, as you would see me happy, do not break an old\nCustom.\"\n\nNiceros, pleased with the frankness of his friend: \"Let me never\nThrive,\" said he, \"if I am not ready to caper out of my skin, to see\nYou in so good a humours; therefore what I say shall be all mirth;\nTho' I am afraid those grave fopps may laugh: but let them look to 't\nI'll go on nevertheless; for what am I the worse for any one swearing?\nI had rather they laugh at what I say, than at my self.\"\n\nThus when he spake---- ----he began this tale:--\n\n\"While I was yet a servant we liv'd in a narrow lane, now the house of\nGavilla: There, as the gods would have it, I fell in love with\nTarentius's wife; he kept an eating-house. Ye all knew Melissa\nTarentina, a pretty little punching-block, and withal beautiful; but\n(so help me Hercules) I minded her not so much for the matter of the\nPoint of that, as that she was good-humour'd; if I asked her any\nThing, she never deny'd me; and what money I had, I trusted her with\nIt; nor did she ever fail me when I'd occasion. It so happened, that\nA she-companion of hers had dy'd in the country, and she was gone\nThither; how to come at her I could not tell; but a friend is seen at\nA dead lift; it also happened my master was gone to Capua to dispatch\nSomewhat or other: I laid hold of the opportunity, and persuaded mine\nHost to take an evenings walk of four or five miles out of town, for\nHe was a stout fellow, and as bold as a devil: The moon shone as\nBright as day, and about cock-crowing we fell in with a burying-place\nAnd certain monument of the dead: my man loitered behind me\nA-star-gazing, and I sitting expecting him, fell a singing and\nNumbering them; when looking round me, what should I see but mine host\nStript stark-naked, and his cloaths lying by the high-wayside. The\nSight struck me every where, and I stood as if I had been dead; but he\nPiss'd round his cloaths, and of a sudden was turned to a wolf: Don't\nThink I jest; I value no man's estate at that rate, as to tell a lye\nBut as I was saying, after he was turned to a wolf, he set up a howl\nAnd fled to the woods. At first I knew not where I was, till going to\nTake up his cloaths, I found them also turn'd to stone. Another man\nWould have dy'd for fear, but I drew my sword, and slaying all the\nGhosts that came in my way, lighted at last on the place where my\nMistress was: I entered the first door; my eyes were sunk in my head\nThe sweat ran off me by more streams than one, and I was just\nBreathing my last, without thought of recovery; when my Melissa coming\nUp to me, began to wonder why I'd be walking so late; and 'if,' said\nShe, 'you had come a little sooner, you might have done us a kindness;\nFor a wolf came into the farm, and has made butchers work enough among\nThe cattle; but tho' he got off, he has no reason to laugh, for a\nServant of ours ran him through the neck with a pitchfork.' As soon as\nI heard her, I could not hold open my eyes any longer, and ran home by\nDaylight, like a vintner whose house had been robb'd: But coming by\nThe place where the cloaths were turned to stone, I saw nothing but a\nPuddle of blood; and when I got home, found mine host lying a-bed like\nAn oxe in his stall, and a chirurgeon dressing his neck. I understood\nAfterwards he was a fellow that could change his skin; but from that\nDay forward, could never eat a bit of bread with him, no, if you'd\nHave kill'd me. Let them that don't believe me, examine the truth of\nIt; may your good angels plague me as I tell ye a lye.\"\n\nThe company were all wondring, when, \"Saving what you have said,\"\nQuoth Trimalchio, \"if there be faith in man, my hair stands on end\nBecause I know Niceros is no trifler; he's sure of what he says, and\nNot given to talking: Nay, I'll tell ye as horrible a thing my self;\nBut see there, what's that behind the hangings?\n\n\"When I was yet a long-hair'd boy, for even then I liv'd a pleasant\nLife, I had a minion, and he dy'd: He was (so help me Hercules) a\nPearl, a paragon, nay perfection it self: But when the poor mother\nLamented him, and we also were doing the same, some witches got round\nThe house on a sudden, you'd have taken them for hounds hunting a\nHare. We had then in the house a Cappadocian, a tall fellow, stout\nAnd hardy, that would not have stept an inch out of his way for\nJupiter. He boldly drew his sword, and wrapping his coat about his\nLeft arm, leaped out of the house, and as it might be here, (no hurt\nTo the thing I touch) ran a woman clean through. We heard a pitiful\nGroan, but not to lye, saw none of them. Our champion came in and\nThrew himself on a bed, but all black and blue, so he had been trosh'd\nWith flails; for it seems some ill hand had touched him. We shut the\nDoor, and went on with our mourning; but the mother taking her son in\nHer arms, and stroaking him, found nothing but a bolster of straw; it\nHad neither heart, entrals, nor any thing, for the fairies belike had\nStollen him out of his cradle, and left that of straw instead of him\nGive me credit, I beseech ye, women are craftier than we are, play\nTheir tricks by night, and turn every thing topsy-turvy. After this\nOur tall fellow never came to his colour again, but in a few days died\nRaving-mad.\"\n\nWe all wondred, as not doubting what he said, and kissing the table in\nReverence to him, pray'd the privilege of the night, and that our\nPlaces might be kept till we returned\n\nAnd now we thought the lamps look'd double, and the whole room seem'd\nQuite another thing, when Trimalchio again, \"I speak to you Plorimus\nWon't you come in for a share? Will ye entertain us with nothing\nThou usedst to be a pleasant companion, couldst sing a song and tell a\nTale with the best; but alas! alas! the sweetmeats are gone.\" \"My\nHorses,\" said the other, \"ran away with my coach, I have been troubled\nWith the gout ever since. When I was a young fellow, I sung so long I\nHad well nigh brought my self into a consumption. What do ye tell me\nOf songs, tales, or barber shops? Who ever came near me but one, only\nApelles;\" and with setting his hand to his mouth, whistled out\nSomewhat, I know not what, which afterwards he swore was Greek\nTrimalchio also when he mimicked the trumpets, looked on his minion\nAnd called him Cr\u00c5\u201csus: Yet the boy was blear-eye'd, and swathing up\nA little black bitch with nasty teeth, and over-grown with fat, in\nGreen swadlingclouts, he set half a loaf on the table, which she\nRefusing, he cram'd her with it: on which Trimalchio commanded the\nGuardian of his house and family, Scylax, to be brought; when\nPresently was led in a beautiful mastiff in a chain, who having a hint\nGiven him by a knock of the porter's foot, lay down before the table:\nWhereupon Trimalchio throwing him a manchet; \"There's no one,\" said\nHe, \"in this house of mine, loves me better than this dog.\" The boy\nTaking it in dudgeon that Scylax should be so commended, laid the\nBitch on the floor, and challenged the dog to have a rubber with him\nOn this Scylax, after the manner of dogs, set up such a hideous\nBarking, that it fill'd the room; and snapping at him, almost rent off\nA brooch that hung on Cr\u00c5\u201csus's breast; nor did the scuffle end\nHere, for the great candle being overturn'd on the table, broke all\nThe chrystal glasses, and threw the scalding oil on the guests\n\nTrimalchio, not to seem concerned at the loss, kissed the boy, and\nCommanded him to get on his back; nor was it long e're he was a\nCock-horse, and slapping his masters shoulders, and laughing, cry'd\nOut, \"Fool, fool, and how many of them have we here?\"\n\nTrimalchio thus kept under for a while, commanded a bumper to be\nFill'd and given round to the waiters, with this further, that\nWhosoever refused it should have it poured down his collar. Thus one\nWhile we were grave, and other while merry\n\nAfter this came junkets and made dishes, the very remembrance of\nWhich, if I may be believed, will not yet down with me; for there were\nSeveral cram'd hens given about under the notion of thrushes, and\nGoose eggs with caps upon them; which Trimalchio, nor without\nOstentation press'd us to eat; adding withal, that their bones were\nTaken out\n\nNor were the words scarce out of his mouth, when a beadle rapp'd at\nThe door, and one in white, with a company of roisters following him\nCame in upon us: For my part I was not a little surprized; and by his\nLordliness taking him for the Mayor of a town, and our selves within\nHis liberties, was getting upon my feet. Agamemnon laught to see me\nSo concerned, and bade me sit still; \"for,\" said he, \"this Habinas is\nA captain of horse, a good mason, and has a special faculty in making\nMonuments.\"\n\nRecovered again with his words, I kept my seat, and wholly fix'd my\nEye on Habinas: He came in drunk, and lolling on his wife's shoulders\nWith some garlands about him, his face all trickling down with\nOintment, he seated himself at the head of the table, and\nIncontinently called for wine and hot water\n\nTrimalchio was pleased with the humour, and calling for a bigger\nGlass, asked him what entertainment he had whence he came?\n\n\"Every thing,\" said the other, \"but thy self; for my inclination was\nHere; tho' (so help me Hercules) it was all well. Scissa kept a\nNine-days feast for his servant Miscellus, whom he infranchised after\nHe was dead: It is said he had a round sum in the chequer, for they\nReckon he died worth 50,000 sesterces; yet this was all done in good\nOrder; tho' every one of us were obliged to pour half his drink on the\nGrave.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Trimalchio, \"what had ye to eat?\" \"I'll tell ye,\" quoth\nHabinas, \"as near as I can, for my memory is not so good, but that\nSometimes I forget my own name: However, for the first dish we had a\nGoodly porker, with a garland upon him, and puddings, goose giblets\nLamb-stones, sweetbreads, and gizzards round him; there were also\nBeets and houshold-bread of his own baking, for himself, which I would\nRather have than white; it makes a man strong, and I never complain of\nWhat I like. The next was a cold tart, with excellent warm honey, and\nThat Spanish, running upon it. I eat little of the tart, but more of\nThe honey; I tasted also the red pulse, and lupines, by the advice of\nCalvus, and several apples, of which I took away two in my\nHandkerchief: for if I bring home nothing to my little she slave, I\nShall have snubs enough: this dame of mine puts me often in mind of\nHer. We had also on a side-table the haunch of a bear, which\nScintilla tasting ere she was aware, had like to have thrown up her\nGuts: I on the other hand eat a pound of it or better, for methought\nIt tasted like boars flesh; and said I, if a bear eats a man, why may\nNot a man much more eat a bear? To be short, we had cream cheese\nWine boil'd off to a third part, fry'd snails, chitterlings, livers\nEggs, turneps, mustard, and a bowl that held a gallon. Don't disturb\nMe, Palamedes; there were also handled about a basket of sugar-cakes\nOf which we wantonly took some, and sent away the gammon of bacon\nBut tell me Caius, I beseech you, what's the matter that Fortunata\nSits not among us?\" \"How came you to know her?\" quoth Trimalchio;\n\"for till she has gotten her plate together, and distributed what we\nLeave among the servants, not a sip of any thing goes into her mouth.\"\n\n\"But unless she sits down,\" replied Habinas, \"I'll be gone\"; and was\nGetting up, but that the word being four times given about for her\nShe came at last in a greenish gown and a cherry-colour'd stomacher\nBeneath which might be seen her petticoat and embroidered garters;\nThen wiping her hands on her neckcloth, she sate on that bed whereon\nScintilla the wife of Habinas was; and having given her a kiss, told\nHer it was in compliment to her that she was there. At length it came\nTo this, that she took off her weighty bracelets, and shewed them to\nScintilla, which she admiring, she also unbuckled her garters and a\nNet-work purse, which she said was of the finest gold\n\nTrimalchio observed it, and commanding all to be laid before him\n\"See,\" said he, \"this womans finery, and what fools our wives make us;\nThey should be six pound and a half; yet I've another of Mercury's\nMaking, that weighs ten\": And that he might not be thought to tell a\nLye, called for his gold scales, and commanded them to be weighed: Nor\nHad Scintilla more wit than t'other, for pulling a golden box out of\nHer bosom, which she called good luck, she took out of it two large\nPearl pendants, giving them in like manner to Fortunata to view:\n\"See,\" quoth she, \"what 'tis to have a kind husband, I am sure no\nWoman has better.\" \"What,\" said Habinas, \"hast thou put the sham on\nMe? thou toldst me thou couldst be contented with glass beads; and for\nThis trick, if I had a daughter I'd cut off her ears; tho' were there\nNo women what were the rest worth? This is to piss warm and drink\nCold.\"\n\nMean time the women perceiving they were toucht, twitter'd among\nThemselves, and being got drunk, fell to kissing one another; one\nCommended the mistress of the house, t'other the master: when during\nThis chatter, Habinas stealing behind Fortunata, gave her such a toss\nOn the bed, that her heels flew as high as her head, on which she gave\nA squeak or two, and finding her thighs bare, ran her head under\nScintilla's smock\n\nThis held a while, till Trimalchio calling for a second service to\nEntertain his new guests, the servants took away the tables that were\nBefore us, and having brought others, strew'd the room with pin-dust\nMixt with vermillion and saffron; and what I never saw before, the\nDust of a looking-glass ground to powder\n\nWhen immediately, quoth Trimalchio, \"I could have been contented with\nThose first dishes; but since we have got other tables, we must also\nHave another service; and if there be any thing worth our having\nBring it.\"\n\nOn which, a spruce boy that served us with warm water, began to\nImitate a nightingale; till Trimalchio giving the word, a servant that\nWaited on Habinas, set up another humour, and, as I believe, commanded\nBy his master, nois'd out;\n\n\"Mean time \u00c3\u2020neas had put off to sea.\"\n\nNor was there ever a harsher sound yet pierced my ears; for besides\nHis disordered country tone, his pitiful and starvling way of\nDelivery, he so stufft it with scraps of verses, that even Virgil then\nFirst disrelished me; till at last so tyr'd, that he could hold no\nLonger; \"D'ye think,\" said Habinas, \"this boy has learn'd nothing? I\nBred him with juglers that follow the fair: Nor has he his fellow\nWhether he humours a muliteer or a jester. This never-be-good has\nAbundance of wit; he's a taylor, a cook, a baker, a jack of all\nTrades, and but for two faults, were exact to a hair: He's\nCrack-brain'd, and snores in his sleep: For that cast of his eye I\nValue it not, he looks like Venus, and therefore his tongue is ever\nRunning; and were that eye out he were worth the money I gave for\nHim.\"\n\nOn which Scintilla interrupting him, told him he was a naughty man\nFor not telling all his servant's good qualities: \"He's a pimp,\" said\nHe, \"if not worse, but I'll take care he be branded for that.\"\n\nTrimalchio laught, and said he knew he was a Cappadocian that never\nBeguiled himself of any thing, and \"(so help me Hercules) I commend\nHim for 't: when will you find such another, but Scintilla, you must\nNot be jealous! Believe me, and I know you too; may I so enjoy the\nHealth you wish me, as I play'd at leap-frog so long with our boy\nThat my master grew jealous, and sent me to dig in the country: But\nHold thy tongue and I'll give thee a loaf.\" I marvel,\" said I\n\"whether they be all mash'd together or made of loam; for in a\nSaturnal at Rome, my self saw the like imaginary shew of a supper.\"\n\nNor had I scarce said it, when--quoth Trimalchio, \"Let me so grow in\nEstate, not bulk, as my cook made all of this out of one hog; there is\nNot an excellenter fellow than himself; he shall, if he please, make\nYe a poll of ling of a sows tripe; a wood-culver of fat bacon; a\nTurtle of a spring of pork; and a hen of a collar of brawn; and\nTherefore of my own fancy, I gave him a name proper to him, for he is\nCalled D\u00c3\u00a6dalus: And because he understands his business, I had\nChopping-knives of the best steel brought him from Rome\"; and with\nThat, calling for them, he turn'd them over, and admiring them\nOffered us the liberty of trying their edge on his cheek\n\nOn this came in two servants as quarrelling about their collars, at\nWhich each of them had a large earthen pot hanging; and when\nTrimalchio determined the matter between them, neither of them stood\nTo his sentence, but fell to club-law, and broke each others pots\n\nThis drunken presumption put us out of order; yet casting an eye on\nThe combatants, we saw oisters and scallops running from the pots, and\nAnother boy receiving them in a charger, which he carried round the\nGuests\n\nNor was the cook's ingenuity short of the rest, for he brought us a\nDish of grill'd snails on a silver gridiron, and with a shrill\nUnpleasant voice, sang as he went. I am asham'd of what follow'd;\nFor, what was never heard of till then, the boys came in with a bason\nOf liquid perfumes, and first binding our legs, ancles and feet, with\nGarlands, anointed them with it, and put the rest into the wine vessel\nAnd the lamps\n\nAnd now Fortunata began to dance, and Scintilla's hands went faster\nThan her tongue; when, quoth Trimalchio, \"Sit down Philargyrus; I give\nYe leave, and you Carrio, because you are a green-ribbon-man, and you\nMinophilus bid your comrade do the like\"; what shall I say more? The\nFamily so crowded upon us, that we were almost thrust off our beds;\nAnd who should be seated above me, but the cook who had made a goose\nOf a hog, all stinking of pickle and kitchen-stuff; nor yet content\nThat he sate amongst us, he fell immediately to personate Thespis the\nTragedian, and dare his master to a wager which of them two should win\nThe prize next wrestling\n\nTrimalchio abash'd at the challenge; \"My friends,\" said he, \"even\nServants are men; and however oppress'd by ill luck, sucked the same\nMilk our selves did; and for mine, it shall not be long e're I make\nThem free without prejudice to my self: to be short, I enfranchise all\nOf them by my last will and testament\n\n\"I give Philargus a country farm, and his she-comrade; to Carrio an\nIsland, with a twentieth part of my moveables, a bed and its\nFurniture; for I make Fortunata my heiress, whom I recommend to all my\nFriends, and publish what I have done, to the end my family may so\nLove me now, as if I were dead.\"\n\nAll thanked their master for his kindness; and he, as having forgotten\nTrifles, called for a copy of his will, which he read from one end to\nThe other, the family all the while sighing and sobbing; afterwards\nTurning to Habinas, \"Tell me, my best of friends,\" said he, \"do you go\nOn with my monument as I directed ye, I earnestly entreat ye, that at\nThe feet of my statue you carve me my little bitch, as also garlands\nAnd ointments, and all the battles I have been in, that by your\nKindness I may live when I am dead: Be sure too that it have an\nHundred feet as it fronts the highway, and as it looks towards the\nFields two hundred: I will also, that there be all sorts of fruit and\nVines round my ashes, and that in great abundance: For it is a gross\nMistake to furnish houses for the living, and take no care of those we\nAre to abide in for ever: And therefore in the first place, I will\nHave it engraven--\n\n'LET NO HEIR OF MINE PRETEND TO THIS MONUMENT.'\n\n\"And that I may receive no injury after I am dead, I'll have a codicil\nAnnext to my will, whereby I'll appoint one of my freed-men the keeper\nOf this monument, that the people make not a house-of-office of it\nMake me also, I beseech you, on this my monument, ships under full\nSail, and my self in my robes sitting on the bench, with five gold\nRings on my fingers, and scattering moneys among the common people;\nFor you know I have ordered ye a funeral feast, and two-pence a-piece\nIn money. You shall also, if you think fit, shape me some of these\nBeds we now sit on, and all the people making their court to me. On\nMy right hand place my Fortunata's statue, with a dove in one hand\nAnd leading a little dog in her girdle with the other: As also my\nCicero, and large wine vessels close cork'd that the wine don't run\nOut, and yet carve one of them as broken, and a boy weeping over it;\nAs also a sun-dial in the middle, that whoever comes to see\nWhat's-a-clock, may read my name whether he will or no. And lastly\nHave a special consideration whether you think this epitaph sufficient\nEnough:\n\n'HERE RESTS CAIUS POMPEIUS TRIMALCHIO, PATRON OF THE LEARNED. A TROOP\nOF HORSE WAS DECREED HIM, WITHOUT SUING FOR, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN A\nSENATOR WOULD HE HAVE ACCEPTED IT. A PIOUS MAN, HONEST, VALIANT, AND\nTRUE TO HIS FRIEND. HE RAISED HIMSELF FROM LITTLE OR NOTHING, BUT\nLEFT BEHIND HIM A PRODIGIOUS ESTATE, YET NEVER HEARD A PHILOSOPHER\nFAREWELL TO YOU ALSO.'\"\n\nThis said, Trimalchio wept plentifully, Fortunata wept, Habinas wept\nAnd the whole family set up a cry as it had been his funeral; nay, I\nAlso whin'd for company: when, quoth Trimalchio, \"Since you know we\nMust die, why don't we live while we may? so let me live my self to\nSee you happy; as, if we plunge our selves in the bath we shall not\nRepent it: At my peril be it; I'll lead the way, for this room is\nGrown as hot as an oven.\" \"Say you so,\" quoth Habinas, \"nor am I\nAfraid to make two days of one\"; and therewith got up barefoot and\nFollow'd Trimalchio\n\nI on the other hand turning to Ascyltos, asked him what he thought of\nIt, for \"if I but see the bath I shall swoon away.\"\n\n\"Let's lagg behind then,\" said he, \"and whilst they are getting in\nWe'll slip off in the crowd.\"\n\nThe contrivance pleased us; and so Gito leading the way through the\nPortico, we came to the last gate, where a chained dog bolted upon us\nSo furiously, that Ascyltos fell into the fishpond. I, who had been\nFrighted at the painted dog, and now gotten as drunk as Ascyltos\nWhile I endeavoured to get hold of him, fell in my self; at last the\nPorter's coming in saved us, for he quieted the dog and drew us out;\nBut Gito, like a sharp rascal, delivered himself, for whatever had\nBeen given him at supper to carry home with him, he threw it the dog\nAnd that mollified him\n\nBut, when shivering with cold, we desired the porter to let us out:\n\"You're mistaken,\" said he, \"if ye think to go out the same way ye\nCame in, for no guest ere yet did; they came in at one gate and are\nLet out by another.\"\n\nIn this sad pickle, what should we do? we found ourselves in a new\nKind of labyrinth, and for bathing, we'd enough of it already:\nHowever, necessity enforcing us, we pray'd him to show us the way to\nThe bath: and Gito having hung out our cloaths a drying in the porch\nWe entred the bath, which was somewhat narrow, and sunk in the earth\nNot unlike a rainwater cistern; in this stood Trimalchio stark-naked:\nNor could we avoid his filthy tricks; for he said, nothing was better\nThan to bathe in a crowd; and that every place had in times past been\nA grinding-house. Being weary at length, he sate down, and provok'd\nBy the noisiness of the bath, set up his drunken throat, and fell a\nMurdering some songs of Menecrates, as they that understood him told\nUs\n\nOther guests ran round the cistern with their arms across, and made a\nClamorous slap with their mouths; others either try'd to take up a\nRing from the pavement, with their hands bound behind them, or putting\nOne knee to the ground, to kiss their great toes backward\n\nWhile they thus entertained one another, we went into the hot-house\nThat had been heated for Trimalchio; and being now recovered of our\nDrunkenness, were brought into another room, where Fortunata had set\nOut a fresh entertainment. Above the lamps I observed some women's\nGewgaws. The tables were massy silver, the earthen ware double gilt\nAnd a conduit running with wine; when, quoth Trimalchio, \"This day, my\nFriends, a servant of mine opened a barber's shop; he's well to pass\nA thrifty fellow, and a favourite of mine: Come, let the floor have a\nDrink as well as our selves; and for our part, we'll sit to it till\nDay-light.\"\n\nWhile he was yet speaking, a cock crow'd, at which Trimalchio grew\nDisordered, and commanded the wine to be thrown under table, and\nSprinkle the larnps with it; then changing a ring to his right hand\n\"it is not for nothing,\" said he, \"this trumpeter has given us notice;\nFor either the house should be on fire, or one of the neighbourhood\nWill kill himself: Far from us be it, and therefore, whoever brings me\nThis discoverer I'll give him a reward.\"\n\nWhen immediately a cock was brought in, and Trimalchio, commanding to\nHave him drest he was torn in pieces by that exquisite cook, who a\nLittle before had make us fish and fowl of a hog, and put in a\nStew-pan, and while D\u00c3\u00a6dalus was taking a lusty draught, Fortunata\nGround pepper\n\nAfter which Trimalchio taking some of the banquet, bid the waiters go\nTo supper, and let others supply their places\n\nWhereupon came in another rank of servants, and as the former going\nCry'd out, \"Farewell, Caius,\" those coming in cry'd out, \"Sit thou\nMerry, Caius.\"\n\nAnd here our mirth first began to be disturb'd; for a beautiful boy\nComing in among those new servants, Trimalchio plucked the boy to him\nAnd did nothing but kiss him over and over: Whereupon Fortunata to\nMaintain her right, began to rail at Trimalchio, called him pitiful\nFellow, one that could not bridle his lust, shame and dishonour to an\nHonest woman, and a very dog. Trimalchio on the other hand, all\nConfounded and vex'd at her taunts, threw a goblet at her head: She\nFell a roaring as if she had lost an eye, and clapt both her hands\nBefore it\n\nScintilla also stood amazed, and covered Fortunata all trembling as\nShe was, in her bosom; the boy also put a cold pitcher to her cheek\nOn which she leaned and made a lamentable wailing and blubbing\n\nBut Trimalchio quite contrary; \"for,\" said he, \"what am I the better\nFor this graceless buttock? 'Tis well known I took her out of a\nBawdy-house, and made her an honest woman, but now blown up like a\nFrog she bespatters herself; a very block, no woman: But this poor boy\nBorn in a hovel, never dreams of palaces. May my good genius so\nBefriend me, as I'll bring down this seeming saint, but in her actions\nA whore rampant: As inconsiderable as she makes me, I might have had a\nWife with two hundred and fifty pistols; you know I don't lye; but she\nWas somewhat in years, and Agatho the sweet oilman, persuaded me not\nTo let my name run out, when instead of doing good to her, I have put\nA thorn in my own foot: but I'll have a care that she dig me not out\nOf my grave with her nails: And that she may know what I'll do at\nPresent, I will not, Habinas, have you put her statue in my monument\nThat I have no words with her when I am dead: Nay, that she may know I\nAm able to plague her, she shall not so much as kiss me when I die.\"\nAfter this ratling, Habinas entreated him to give over his anger;\n\"There's none of us all,\" said he, \"but some time or other does amiss;\nWe are but men, not gods.\" Weeping Scintilla said the same, called\nHim Caius, and by his own good nature, besought him to be pacified\n\nTrimalchio not able to hold tears any longer, \"I beg of you, Habinas,\"\nSaid he, \"and as you wish to enjoy what you have gotten, if I have\nDone any thing without cause, spit in my face: I kiss'd the boy 'tis\nTrue, not for his beauty, but that he's a hopeful thrifty lad: He has\nSeveral sentences by heart, can read a book at first sight; saves\nMoney out of his days provision; has a binn of his own to keep it, and\nTwo drinking cups; and does he not deserve to be in my eye? but\nFortunata, forsooth, will not have it so; your bandy legs won't away\nWith it. Be content with your own, thou she-kite, and don't disquiet\nMe, thou harlotry, or otherwise thou'lt find what I am; thou knowest\nWell enough, if I once set on't, 'tis immoveable. But we'll remember\nThe living\n\n\"Come, my friends, let's see how merry ye can be, for in my time I\nHave been no better than your selves, but by my own industry I am what\nI am: 'Tis the heart makes a man, all the rest is but stuff. I buy\nCheap and sell dear; another man may sell ye other things, but I enjoy\nMy self; and thou dunghillraker, are thou yet gruntling, I'll make ye\nHereafter do it for somewhat\n\n\"But as I was saying my frugality brought the fortune I have: I came\nOut of Asia no taller than this candlestick, and daily measured my\nSelf by it: and that I might get a beard the sooner, rubb'd my lips\nWith the candle-grease; yet I kept Ganymede to my master fourteen\nYears (nor is any thing dishonourable that the master commands) and\nThe same time contented my mistress: Ye know what I mean, I'll say no\nMore, for I am no boaster. By this means, as the gods would have it\nThe governing the house was committed to me, and nothing was done but\nBy my guidance: What need many words? He made me joint-heir with\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar, and I had by it a Senator's estate; but no man thinks he has\nEnough, and I had a mighty desire to turn merchant. Not to detain you\nLonger; I built five ships, freighted them with wines, which at that\nTime were as dear as gold, and sent them to Rome; you'll think I\nDesir'd to have it so: All my ships founder'd at sea; 'tis a great\nTruth, no story; Neptune swallowed me in one day three hundred\nThousand sesterties. Do ye think I broke upon 't, (so help me\nHercules) no; the loss was but a flea-bite: For, as if there had been\nNo such thing, I built others, larger, better, and more fortunate than\nThe former; so that every one called me a man of courage. As you know\nA great ship carries a great deal of force, I loaded them again with\nWine, bacon, beans, unguents, planes: And here Fortunata shewed her\nAffection; for she sold what she had; nay, her very cloaths, and put a\nRound sum in my pocket; tho' yet it was but a pig of my own sow. What\nThe gods will is quickly done; I got an hundred thousand sesterties by\nThe voyage, and forthwith redeemed the lands my patron had left me\nBuilt me a house, bought cattle to sell them again, and whatever I\nWent about gathered like a snow-ball: But when I grew richer than all\nThe country besides, I took up; and from a merchant turn'd usurer, and\nBought servants\n\n\"Thus resolved to give over trading, a certain astrologer that chanc'd\nTo light on this village, would have persuaded me to the contrary. He\nWas a Gr\u00c3\u00a6cian, his name S\u00c5\u201crapa, one that held correspondence\nWith the gods. He told me a deal that I had forgotten, and laid\nEverything before me from top to bottom: He knew all I had within me\nAnd told me what I had the night before to supper; you'd have thought\nHe had liv'd with me all his life\n\n\"I beseech you, Habinas, for I think you was there; he told me the\nIntrigue between my mistress and me; that I had but ill luck at\nFriends; that no one ever made me a return of my kindnesses: That I\nHad large possessions, but nourished a viper in my bosom: Why should I\nNot tell you all? I have by his account, thirty years, four months\nAnd two days yet to live; and in a short time shall have another\nEstate left me\n\n\"Thus my fortune-teller. But if I can join my lands here to those in\nApulia, I shall do well enough: in the mean, and while Mercury is my\nGuardian, I have built this house: it was once you know, a pitiful\nCabin, but now as magnificent as a temple: it has four dining rooms\nTwenty bed-chambers two marble porticoes, a gallery above stairs, my\nOwn apartment, another for this viper; a very good porter's lodge, and\nThe house capable of receiving a thousand guests: To be short, when\nEver Scaurus comes this way, he had rather lodge here than at his own\nHouse, tho' it lie to the seaward: and many other conveniences it has\nWhich I'll shew you by and by. Believe me, he that has a penny in his\nPurse, is worth a penny: Have and you shall be esteemed. And so your\nFriend, once no better than a frog, is now a king\n\n\"And now Stichus bring me the furniture in which I design to be\nCarried to my funeral pile; bring also the unguent, and some of that\nPot, which I ordered for the cleansing my bones.\"\n\nStichus lingered not, but brought in a white coverlet, and robe of\nState, and pray'd us to try if they were not fine wooll, and well\nWoven. \"And see you Stichus,\" said Trimalchio smiling, \"that neither\nMice nor moths come at them, for if they do I'll burn you alive. I\nWill be brought out in pomp, that all the people may speak well of\nMe.\"\n\nWith that opening a glass bottle of spicknard, he caused us all to be\nAnointed; and \"I hope,\" said he, \"it will do as much good when I am\nDead, as it does while I am living\": Then commanding the wine vessels\nTo be filled again; \"Fausie,\" said he, \"you are invited to my funeral\nFeast.\" We by this time nauseated, were ready to vomit; Trimalchio\nAlso was gotten confoundedly drunk, when behold, a new interlude; he\nCalled for the coronets to come in; and, underset with pillows, and\nStretching himself at length on the bed, \"suppose me,\" said he, \"now\nDead, say somewhat, I beseech you, in praise of me.\"\n\nWhereupon the coronets sounded as it had been at a funeral; but one\nAbove the rest, a servant of that freed-man of Trimalchio's, that was\nBest condition'd of 'em all, made such a thundring, that it rais'd the\nNeighbourhood: On which the watch thinking the house was on fire\nBroke open the gate, and making an uproar after their manner, ran in\nWith water and hatchets: When finding so fair an opportunity, we gave\nAgamemnon the slip, and scamper'd off, as if it had been a real fire", "LikeWhatLikeMe": "\nMan on the moon, if my dream works\nSmile, picture the cheese, extreme perks\nShooting stars, please me first...\nSpaced out face to lace the merchandise
